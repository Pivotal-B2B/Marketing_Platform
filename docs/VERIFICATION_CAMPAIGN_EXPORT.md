# Verification Campaign Export Guide

This guide explains how to export verification campaign results to CSV format.

## üìä Overview

The export system allows you to download verification campaign contacts as CSV files with flexible filtering options. All exports are securely uploaded to S3 and accessed via presigned download URLs (15-minute expiry).

## üöÄ Export Endpoints

### 1. Custom Export with Filters

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/verification-campaigns/:campaignId/export`

Export contacts with custom filtering criteria.

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "eligibilityStatuses": ["Eligible", "Pending_Email_Validation"],  // Optional
  "verificationStatuses": ["Validated"],                            // Optional
  "emailStatuses": ["ok", "risky"],                                 // Optional

}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "downloadUrl": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/...",
  "expiresIn": "900s",
  "totalRecords": 1234,
  "fileName": "campaign-name-2025-10-26.csv",
  "filters": {
    "eligibilityStatuses": ["Eligible"],
    "verificationStatuses": ["Validated"],
    "emailStatuses": ["ok"],
    "suppressed": false,
    "inSubmissionBuffer": false
  }
}
```

### 2. Quick Export Presets

Pre-configured export endpoints for common use cases.

## üí° Usage Examples

### Example 1: Export All Ready Contacts

```bash
curl -X POST \
  "http://localhost:5000/api/verification-campaigns/abc123/export/ready-for-delivery" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "downloadUrl": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/bucket/verification-exports/abc123/campaign-name-2025-10-26.csv?...",
  "expiresIn": "900s",
  "totalRecords": 523,
  "fileName": "campaign-name-2025-10-26.csv"
}
```

### Example 2: Custom Filter Export

```bash
curl -X POST \
  "http://localhost:5000/api/verification-campaigns/abc123/export" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "eligibilityStatuses": ["Eligible", "Pending_Email_Validation"],
    "verificationStatuses": ["Validated", "To_Review"],
    "emailStatuses": ["ok", "risky"],
    "suppressed": false
  }'
```

### Example 3: Export Submission Buffer

```bash
curl -X POST \
  "http://localhost:5000/api/verification-campaigns/abc123/export/submission-buffer" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

## üîç Filter Options

### Eligibility Statuses
- `Eligible` - Passed geo/title criteria
- `Ineligible_Geography` - Failed geography check
- `Ineligible_Title` - Failed title check
- `Ineligible_Email_Invalid` - Email validation failed (syntax/DNS)
- `Ineligible_Email_Risky` - Email is risky (role account, free provider)
- `Ineligible_Email_Disposable` - Disposable/temp email detected
- `Pending_Email_Validation` - Awaiting email validation
- `Excluded` - Manually excluded

### Verification Statuses
- `New` - Newly added contact
- `Validated` - Verified as valid
- `Invalid` - Verified as invalid
- `To_Review` - Needs manual review

### Email Statuses
- `ok` - Email is valid and deliverable
- `invalid` - Email failed validation
- `risky` - Valid but has risk factors
- `accept_all` - Catch-all server (may or may not deliver)
- `disposable` - Disposable email service
- `unknown` - Validation incomplete

## üîí Security & Access

- **Authentication Required:** All export endpoints require a valid JWT token
- **S3 Security:** Files are uploaded to private S3 buckets
- **Presigned URLs:** Download links expire after 15 minutes (900 seconds)
- **File Location:** `s3://bucket/verification-exports/{campaignId}/{filename}.csv`

## ‚ö° Performance Notes

### Large Exports

For campaigns with >10,000 contacts:
- Export is processed synchronously (may take 10-30 seconds)
- All contacts are loaded into memory before CSV generation
- Consider implementing pagination or streaming for very large datasets

### Optimization Tips

1. **Filter Early:** Use specific filters to reduce export size
2. **Scheduled Exports:** Run exports during off-peak hours
3. **Caching:** Download URLs are cached for 15 minutes - share the same URL

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "No contacts found" Error

**Cause:** No contacts match your filter criteria

**Solution:** 
- Check filter values (typos in status names)
- Verify campaign has contacts
- Remove filters to see all contacts

### "Campaign not found" Error

**Cause:** Invalid campaign ID

**Solution:** Verify the campaign ID is correct

### Download URL Expired

**Cause:** Presigned URL is only valid for 15 minutes

**Solution:** Re-request the export to get a new download URL

### Export Takes Too Long

**Cause:** Very large dataset

**Solution:**
- Use more specific filters to reduce export size
- Consider exporting in smaller batches
- Check server logs for processing time

## üìä Export Use Cases

### 1. Client Delivery Workflow

```
1. Filter: ready-for-delivery
2. Download CSV
3. Deliver to client
4. Mark as submitted
```

### 2. External Email Validation

```
1. Export eligible contacts
2. Validate with external service (ZeroBounce, NeverBounce)
3. Upload validation results
4. Export validated contacts for delivery
```

### 3. Quality Assurance

```
1. Export: verificationStatus = "To_Review"
2. Manual review in spreadsheet
3. Update statuses via bulk upload
4. Export validated results
```

### 4. Campaign Analytics

```
1. Export all contacts (including deleted)
2. Analyze in Excel/BI tool
3. Generate reports on:
   - Eligibility rates
   - Email validation pass rates
   - Geographic distribution

POST /api/verification-campaigns/{id}/submission/clear
```

## üìù Next Steps
