14) Contact & Account Management Upgrade Plan
14.1 Overview

The Accounts and Contacts modules currently have foundational CRUD capabilities but lack relational depth, enrichment fields, and advanced data management tools.
This phase focuses on turning the module into a complete ABM-grade data engine, enabling accurate linking, advanced filtering, detailed record navigation, and mass operations.

14.2 Required Field Implementation (Heads-Up)

⚠️ Mandatory fields not yet fully implemented or validated

Accounts (Company):

Field	Purpose	Current Status
industry	Key for segmentation and ABM tiering	Implemented
domain	Used for linking to contacts (must be unique, validated)	Partially implemented
linkedin_url	Company LinkedIn page	Implemented
linkedin_specialties	Text array; enrich ABM profiling	❌ Missing
technologies_installed	Array of tech stack identifiers (e.g., HubSpot, AWS, Salesforce)	❌ Missing
annual_revenue, employees_size_range	Segmentation metrics	Implemented
hq_city, hq_country, hq_state	Geo segmentation	Implemented
parent_account_id	Hierarchical relationship	❌ Missing
tags[], intent_topics[]	Thematic enrichment	Partial

Contacts:

Field	Purpose	Current Status
account_id	Foreign key linking to company	❌ Missing
job_title, department, seniority_level	Targeting logic	Implemented
email_verification_status	Compliance & quality	Implemented
consent_basis, consent_source, consent_ts	GDPR/CCPA compliance	❌ Missing
linkedin_url	Contact social link	Implemented
intent_topics[]	Buyer interest signals	Partial
direct_phone, phone_verified_at	Telemarketing validation	❌ Missing
tags[]	Custom labels	❌ Missing

Action: All above fields must be fully integrated into both API and UI layers, with validation (type, uniqueness, format) and migration scripts.

14.3 Data Model Enhancements

Enhance schema to include:

ALTER TABLE accounts
ADD COLUMN linkedin_specialties TEXT[],
ADD COLUMN technologies_installed TEXT[],
ADD COLUMN parent_account_id UUID REFERENCES accounts(id) ON DELETE SET NULL;


Both linkedin_specialties and technologies_installed will be indexed using GIN for text-search filters.

14.4 Linking & Relationship Management

Automatic linking between contacts.email_domain ↔ accounts.domain

Manual linking UI in both Account and Contact detail pages

Cascade display of associated Contacts in Account view

Quick navigation: “View Company” button from Contact details

14.5 Advanced Search & Filtering

Multi-field logical queries (AND/OR)

Cross-entity filters (Contacts where Account.industry = 'IT')

Include new fields in filters (technologies_installed, linkedin_specialties)

Saved and shared filter views per user

14.6 Record Detail Views

Account Details:

Tabs: Overview | Contacts | Activity | Notes | Files

Include side panel summary: Industry, Domain, Technologies Installed, LinkedIn Specialties, Revenue, Owner

Quick Actions: Edit, Merge, Add Contact, Export Contacts

Contact Details:

Tabs: Overview | Account Info | Activity | Notes

Include “Linked Account” mini-card with link to parent Account

Navigation: Previous / Next record and breadcrumb trail

14.7 Bulk Operations

Bulk select / bulk update (assign owner, edit fields)

Bulk delete (soft delete with undo period)

Bulk export with selectable columns

Bulk import validation with per-field error queue

14.8 Validation & Compliance

Enforce E.164 for all phone fields

Require email + account_id (or domain match) on Contact creation

Enforce uniqueness of account.domain

Automatic audit logging for all bulk actions

Field-level RBAC: restrict visibility of consent fields to Admin roles only
