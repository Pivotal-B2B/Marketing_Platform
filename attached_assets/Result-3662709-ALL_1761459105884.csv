Having entered the rough and tumble world of aviation, the government finally took 100% share in Kuwait Airways.
 
Kuwait Airways entered the jet age in 1962 by leasing a Comet 4-C, the world's first jet-engined airliner.

In 1978, Kuwait Airways entered the wide-body age by taking delivery of its first two B747-200s, adding a third the following year. This expansion permitted Kuwait Airways to extend its network to New York to the west and Manila to the east. 
Modernization of the fleet continued, and four B727-200s were delivered in 1980-1981. Two years later, eight Airbus A310s and A300-600s were delivered, and in 1986 three Boeing 767-200ER aircraft joined the wide-body fleet.

On the wave of the oil boom of the 1940s, a national carrier was born in 1954. Initially, Kuwait Airways Company served a limited network of Basra, Abadan, Beirut, Damascus and Jerusalem; however, a year later the fledgling carrier was facing economic hardship, and the government of Kuwait took a 50% interest in the airline, subsequently doubling the company's capital. Having entered the rough and tumble world of aviation, the government finally took 100% share in Kuwait Airways.
 
Kuwait Airways entered the jet age in 1962 by leasing a Comet 4-C, the world's first jet-engined airliner. In the 1960s, the national carrier rapidly expanded its route map, and scheduled services to London began three times a week. To keep pace with fast-moving aviation requirements, three Boeing 707s were delivered in 1968. Ten years later, Kuwait Airways had an all Boeing 707 fleet of eight aircraft. 
 
In 1978, Kuwait Airways entered the wide-body age by taking delivery of its first two B747-200s, adding a third the following year. This expansion permitted Kuwait Airways to extend its network to New York to the west and Manila to the east. 
Modernization of the fleet continued, and four B727-200s were delivered in 1980-1981. Two years later, eight Airbus A310s and A300-600s were delivered, and in 1986 three Boeing 767-200ER aircraft joined the wide-body fleet.
 
Following the destruction of its premises and 15 of its aircraft during the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, the airline was relaunched. Moreover, the company was restored after the Liberation of Kuwait, and a basic strategy was constituted to expand its operations around the world. After the Liberation of Kuwait until 1998, the Kuwaiti Airways fleet consisted of 17 aircraft.
 
In 2016, the airline was formally registered as a private company and its Corporate identity was rebranded to reflect its modernization and transformation.",1954,$1M - $5M,2500000,https://www.linkedin.com/company/kuwait-airways,25 years,6 months,"10,001+ employees",abdulwahab.alshatti@kuwaitairways.com,abdulwahab.alshatti,kuwaitairways.com,safe,98,true,true,false,false,true,asc-me-mx2.titanhq.com; asc-me-mx1.titanhq.com,true,false,false,true,false,false,false

On the wave of the oil boom of the 1940s, a national carrier was born in 1954. Initially, Kuwait Airways Company served a limited network of Basra, Abadan, Beirut, Damascus and Jerusalem; however, a year later the fledgling carrier was facing economic hardship, and the government of Kuwait took a 50% interest in the airline, subsequently doubling the company's capital. Having entered the rough and tumble world of aviation, the government finally took 100% share in Kuwait Airways.
 
Kuwait Airways entered the jet age in 1962 by leasing a Comet 4-C, the world's first jet-engined airliner. In the 1960s, the national carrier rapidly expanded its route map, and scheduled services to London began three times a week. To keep pace with fast-moving aviation requirements, three Boeing 707s were delivered in 1968. Ten years later, Kuwait Airways had an all Boeing 707 fleet of eight aircraft. 
 
In 1978, Kuwait Airways entered the wide-body age by taking delivery of its first two B747-200s, adding a third the following year. This expansion permitted Kuwait Airways to extend its network to New York to the west and Manila to the east. 
Modernization of the fleet continued, and four B727-200s were delivered in 1980-1981. Two years later, eight Airbus A310s and A300-600s were delivered, and in 1986 three Boeing 767-200ER aircraft joined the wide-body fleet.
 
Following the destruction of its premises and 15 of its aircraft during the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, the airline was relaunched. Moreover, the company was restored after the Liberation of Kuwait, and a basic strategy was constituted to expand its operations around the world. After the Liberation of Kuwait until 1998, the Kuwaiti Airways fleet consisted of 17 aircraft.
 
In 2016, the airline was formally registered as a private company and its Corporate identity was rebranded to reflect its modernization and transformation.",1954,$1M - $5M,2500000,https://www.linkedin.com/company/kuwait-airways,,,"10,001+ employees",ahmad.fhaid@kuwaitairways.com,ahmad.fhaid,kuwaitairways.com,safe,98,true,true,false,false,true,asc-me-mx2.titanhq.com; asc-me-mx1.titanhq.com,true,false,false,true,false,false,false

On the wave of the oil boom of the 1940s, a national carrier was born in 1954. Initially, Kuwait Airways Company served a limited network of Basra, Abadan, Beirut, Damascus and Jerusalem; however, a year later the fledgling carrier was facing economic hardship, and the government of Kuwait took a 50% interest in the airline, subsequently doubling the company's capital. Having entered the rough and tumble world of aviation, the government finally took 100% share in Kuwait Airways.
 
Kuwait Airways entered the jet age in 1962 by leasing a Comet 4-C, the world's first jet-engined airliner. In the 1960s, the national carrier rapidly expanded its route map, and scheduled services to London began three times a week. To keep pace with fast-moving aviation requirements, three Boeing 707s were delivered in 1968. Ten years later, Kuwait Airways had an all Boeing 707 fleet of eight aircraft. 
 
In 1978, Kuwait Airways entered the wide-body age by taking delivery of its first two B747-200s, adding a third the following year. This expansion permitted Kuwait Airways to extend its network to New York to the west and Manila to the east. 
Modernization of the fleet continued, and four B727-200s were delivered in 1980-1981. Two years later, eight Airbus A310s and A300-600s were delivered, and in 1986 three Boeing 767-200ER aircraft joined the wide-body fleet.
 
Following the destruction of its premises and 15 of its aircraft during the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, the airline was relaunched. Moreover, the company was restored after the Liberation of Kuwait, and a basic strategy was constituted to expand its operations around the world. After the Liberation of Kuwait until 1998, the Kuwaiti Airways fleet consisted of 17 aircraft.
 
In 2016, the airline was formally registered as a private company and its Corporate identity was rebranded to reflect its modernization and transformation.",1954,$1M - $5M,2500000,https://www.linkedin.com/company/kuwait-airways,14 years,14 years,"10,001+ employees",a.alajmi@kuwaitairways.com,a.alajmi,kuwaitairways.com,safe,98,true,true,false,false,true,asc-me-mx1.titanhq.com; asc-me-mx2.titanhq.com,true,false,false,true,false,false,false

Furthermore, it swiftly secured clearance for the Jakarta – Singapore route, underscoring its agility and strategic positioning. Since October 2022, under new ownership and management, TransNusa has served over 1 million passengers by December 2023.
TransNusa has adopted a unique business model, responding to post-pandemic passenger preferences, and positioning itself as a Premium Service Carrier globally. This approach emphasizes comprehensive services geared towards passenger comfort and flexibility. The airline's inaugural international route from Jakarta to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, launched on April 14, 2023.
In 2024, TransNusa aims to establish an additional domestic hub and expand its network with more domestic and international routes. Established in 2005, TransNusa ceased operations in 2020 due to the pandemic. However, a change in ownership and management in 2022 revitalized the airline. Since then, TransNusa has rebranded itself as a Premium Service Carrier, committed to providing unparalleled comfort and flexibility to its customers.",2005,$20M - $50M,35000000,https://www.linkedin.com/company/transnusa,2 years,2 years,"501 - 1,000 employees",benjamin.natawardaja@transnusa.co.id,benjamin.natawardaja,transnusa.co.id,catch_all,75,false,true,false,false,true,alt4.aspmx.l.google.com; aspmx.l.google.com; alt2.aspmx.l.google.com; alt1.aspmx.l.google.com; alt3.aspmx.l.google.com,true,false,true,true,false,false,false

On the wave of the oil boom of the 1940s, a national carrier was born in 1954. Initially, Kuwait Airways Company served a limited network of Basra, Abadan, Beirut, Damascus and Jerusalem; however, a year later the fledgling carrier was facing economic hardship, and the government of Kuwait took a 50% interest in the airline, subsequently doubling the company's capital. Having entered the rough and tumble world of aviation, the government finally took 100% share in Kuwait Airways.
 
Kuwait Airways entered the jet age in 1962 by leasing a Comet 4-C, the world's first jet-engined airliner. In the 1960s, the national carrier rapidly expanded its route map, and scheduled services to London began three times a week. To keep pace with fast-moving aviation requirements, three Boeing 707s were delivered in 1968. Ten years later, Kuwait Airways had an all Boeing 707 fleet of eight aircraft. 
 
In 1978, Kuwait Airways entered the wide-body age by taking delivery of its first two B747-200s, adding a third the following year. This expansion permitted Kuwait Airways to extend its network to New York to the west and Manila to the east. 
Modernization of the fleet continued, and four B727-200s were delivered in 1980-1981. Two years later, eight Airbus A310s and A300-600s were delivered, and in 1986 three Boeing 767-200ER aircraft joined the wide-body fleet.
 
Following the destruction of its premises and 15 of its aircraft during the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, the airline was relaunched. Moreover, the company was restored after the Liberation of Kuwait, and a basic strategy was constituted to expand its operations around the world. After the Liberation of Kuwait until 1998, the Kuwaiti Airways fleet consisted of 17 aircraft.
 
In 2016, the airline was formally registered as a private company and its Corporate identity was rebranded to reflect its modernization and transformation.",1954,$1M - $5M,2500000,https://www.linkedin.com/company/kuwait-airways,8 years,3 years,"10,001+ employees",mohammad.jamali@kuwaitairways.com,mohammad.jamali,kuwaitairways.com,safe,98,true,true,false,false,true,asc-me-mx2.titanhq.com; asc-me-mx1.titanhq.com,true,false,false,true,false,false,false

On the wave of the oil boom of the 1940s, a national carrier was born in 1954. Initially, Kuwait Airways Company served a limited network of Basra, Abadan, Beirut, Damascus and Jerusalem; however, a year later the fledgling carrier was facing economic hardship, and the government of Kuwait took a 50% interest in the airline, subsequently doubling the company's capital. Having entered the rough and tumble world of aviation, the government finally took 100% share in Kuwait Airways.
 
Kuwait Airways entered the jet age in 1962 by leasing a Comet 4-C, the world's first jet-engined airliner. In the 1960s, the national carrier rapidly expanded its route map, and scheduled services to London began three times a week. To keep pace with fast-moving aviation requirements, three Boeing 707s were delivered in 1968. Ten years later, Kuwait Airways had an all Boeing 707 fleet of eight aircraft. 
 
In 1978, Kuwait Airways entered the wide-body age by taking delivery of its first two B747-200s, adding a third the following year. This expansion permitted Kuwait Airways to extend its network to New York to the west and Manila to the east. 
Modernization of the fleet continued, and four B727-200s were delivered in 1980-1981. Two years later, eight Airbus A310s and A300-600s were delivered, and in 1986 three Boeing 767-200ER aircraft joined the wide-body fleet.
 
Following the destruction of its premises and 15 of its aircraft during the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, the airline was relaunched. Moreover, the company was restored after the Liberation of Kuwait, and a basic strategy was constituted to expand its operations around the world. After the Liberation of Kuwait until 1998, the Kuwaiti Airways fleet consisted of 17 aircraft.
 
In 2016, the airline was formally registered as a private company and its Corporate identity was rebranded to reflect its modernization and transformation.",1954,$1M - $5M,2500000,https://www.linkedin.com/company/kuwait-airways,22 years,12 years,"10,001+ employees",marika.faresin@kuwaitairways.com,marika.faresin,kuwaitairways.com,safe,98,true,true,false,false,true,asc-me-mx1.titanhq.com; asc-me-mx2.titanhq.com,true,false,false,true,false,false,false

Over the first twenty years Fujairah Aviation Academy has provided professional aviation education for students requiring the Private Pilots License and the Commercial Pilots License. With the emergence of the United Arab Emirates as a world class business centre bringing innovation, expertise and technology to the region, we enter into our third decade being proud to introduce an Academy of Aviation Excellence in the form of the first dedicated Airline Transport Pilots License School in the Middle East.

All of the Fujairah Aviation Academy’s courses are approved by the UAE GCAA, and upon successful completion, result in the issue of a UAE licence. The UAE is a member of International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). Licences issued by the UAE are convertible to the licences of other ICAO states, subject to their civil aviation regulations.

Airport in Madinah, Saudi Arabia. 
The Government of Saudi Arabia realized from the outset the importance of the private sector as an economic development partner, and the civil aviation sector is ambitious; having ideal investment factors. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is a country with an important geographical location and a unique religious significance in the Muslim world. Furthermore, due to its economic strength and openness, investments in the sector are attracted to the belief that they will be successfully developed. Given the importance and the role of the air transport sector in the service of pilgrims and visitors to the Prophet's mosque, the government was directed to transform Prince Mohammad Bin Abdulaziz Intl. Airport in Madinah to a world-class airport. In this context, international participation was ensured in this project, the first Public-Private Partnership (PPP) project in KSA; with an ambitious plan to modernize and expand the airport with private sector participation under the long-term concession. 
Ten international, regional, and local firms submitted qualification applications. Four consortia ultimately submitted bids on 8 August 2011. Technical bids were evaluated and scored before opening financial bids. After determining a final score, Tibah was awarded the concession.
On 29/10/2011 the Build, Transfer, and Operate Agreement (BTO), was signed between the GACA and Tibah to initialize the first airport project in the Middle East to be fully built under PPP.
The project was inaugurated on 2nd July 2015 by The Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques King Salman bin Abdulaziz al Saud, in the presence of other major dignitaries from the kingdom.

Founded by IIT Kanpur alumni, TECHEAGLE started with a problem, not a product: How can essential goods like medicines or emergency supplies reach remote regions faster, without relying on unreliable roads or traditional logistics? That question sparked India’s drone logistics movement.
Today, TECHEAGLE is a full-stack deeptech company developing autonomous drone systems, spanning hardware, software, ground infra, and flight operations.
We serve four key sectors:
• Healthcare: Live BVLOS deliveries of medicines and vaccines across AIIMS and MoHFW corridors
• Quick Commerce: Fast, cost-effective last-mile and mid-mile delivery for e-commerce and quick commerce
• Public Safety: Real-time disaster response and emergency delivery in flood-prone and remote regions
• Defense: Tactical logistics and ISR-ready drones for national security and dual-use operations
Our systems are:
• BVLOS-compliant, field-tested, and DGCA-approved
• Designed and built in Bharat, optimized for diverse terrains
• Powered by our proprietary tech stack: FleetOS, Command Center, OMS, UTM-lite, and Payload Pods
• Deployed using a asset light model for easy partner integration and scale
With 500+ drones in the deployment pipeline and operations across 10+ Indian states, TECHEAGLE is laying the foundation for aerial infrastructure that enables speed, resilience, and autonomy at scale.
We are not just building drones. We are building the next layer of infrastructure, intelligence, and impact to serve lives, supply chains, and sovereignty.
Whether you're an investor, policymaker, partner, or builder: let's co- a future where autonomy lifts Bharat.

It is the only private company ever to return a spacecraft from low-Earth orbit, which it first accomplished in December 2010.

On the wave of the oil boom of the 1940s, a national carrier was born in 1954. Initially, Kuwait Airways Company served a limited network of Basra, Abadan, Beirut, Damascus and Jerusalem; however, a year later the fledgling carrier was facing economic hardship, and the government of Kuwait took a 50% interest in the airline, subsequently doubling the company's capital. Having entered the rough and tumble world of aviation, the government finally took 100% share in Kuwait Airways.
 
Kuwait Airways entered the jet age in 1962 by leasing a Comet 4-C, the world's first jet-engined airliner. In the 1960s, the national carrier rapidly expanded its route map, and scheduled services to London began three times a week. To keep pace with fast-moving aviation requirements, three Boeing 707s were delivered in 1968. Ten years later, Kuwait Airways had an all Boeing 707 fleet of eight aircraft. 
 
In 1978, Kuwait Airways entered the wide-body age by taking delivery of its first two B747-200s, adding a third the following year. This expansion permitted Kuwait Airways to extend its network to New York to the west and Manila to the east. 
Modernization of the fleet continued, and four B727-200s were delivered in 1980-1981. Two years later, eight Airbus A310s and A300-600s were delivered, and in 1986 three Boeing 767-200ER aircraft joined the wide-body fleet.
 
Following the destruction of its premises and 15 of its aircraft during the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, the airline was relaunched. Moreover, the company was restored after the Liberation of Kuwait, and a basic strategy was constituted to expand its operations around the world. After the Liberation of Kuwait until 1998, the Kuwaiti Airways fleet consisted of 17 aircraft.
 
In 2016, the airline was formally registered as a private company and its Corporate identity was rebranded to reflect its modernization and transformation.",1954,$1M - $5M,2500000,https://www.linkedin.com/company/kuwait-airways,11 years,11 years,"10,001+ employees",fawaz.alenezi@kuwaitairways.com,fawaz.alenezi,kuwaitairways.com,safe,98,true,true,false,false,true,asc-me-mx2.titanhq.com; asc-me-mx1.titanhq.com,true,false,false,true,false,false,false

Since then Dragon has delivered cargo to and from the space station multiple times, providing regular cargo resupply missions for NASA.

Malaysia Airports manages and operates 39 airports in Malaysia and one international airport in Istanbul, Turkey. The 39 airports in Malaysia comprise of 5 international, 17 domestic and 17 Short Take-Off and Landing Ports (STOL Ports). Malaysia Airports is the company that helps connect the country – bringing together remote, rural communities with the vibrant cities and providing the country’s premier gateway to the world beyond.

Our core business is the management, operation, maintenance and development of airports. The company draws its revenue from aeronautical operations – aircraft landing and parking fees, passenger service charges and other airline charges – and commercial activities from airport-related services such as duty free shops and other retail outlets, hotel operations, commercial leasing and car park management.

Over the past decades, Malaysia Airports has developed a business model that focuses not only on the airports portfolio, but also on optimising the commercial opportunities presented by the travel and aviation industry. As we move forward, our new goal is to develop the “Airport City” of the future – providing world-class aeronautical services while fully utilising surrounding land banks to develop malls, hotels and leisure facilities to ensure a joyful experiences not only for the contemporary traveller, but also for all Malaysia Airports’ clients and business partners.",1991,$1B+,1000000001,https://www.linkedin.com/company/malaysia-airports,8 years,5 years,"5,001 - 10,000 employees",jimmyshar@malaysiaairports.com.my,jimmyshar,malaysiaairports.com.my,safe,98,true,true,false,false,true,alt4.aspmx.l.google.com; alt1.aspmx.l.google.com; alt2.aspmx.l.google.com; aspmx.l.google.com; alt3.aspmx.l.google.com,true,false,false,true,false,false,false

About Malaysia Airports

Malaysia Airports manages and operates 39 airports in Malaysia and one international airport in Istanbul, Turkey. The 39 airports in Malaysia comprise of 5 international, 17 domestic and 17 Short Take-Off and Landing Ports (STOL Ports). Malaysia Airports is the company that helps connect the country – bringing together remote, rural communities with the vibrant cities and providing the country’s premier gateway to the world beyond.

Malaysia Airports was corporatised in 1992 and listed on the Malaysian Stock Exchange (Bursa Malaysia) seven years later, becoming the first Asian airport operator to go public and only the sixth in the world to do so. It now employs some 11,000 people in Malaysia and around the world.

Our core business is the management, operation, maintenance and development of airports. The company draws its revenue from aeronautical operations – aircraft landing and parking fees, passenger service charges and other airline charges – and commercial activities from airport-related services such as duty free shops and other retail outlets, hotel operations, commercial leasing and car park management.

Over the past decades, Malaysia Airports has developed a business model that focuses not only on the airports portfolio, but also on optimising the commercial opportunities presented by the travel and aviation industry. As we move forward, our new goal is to develop the “Airport City” of the future – providing world-class aeronautical services while fully utilising surrounding land banks to develop malls, hotels and leisure facilities to ensure a joyful experiences not only for the contemporary traveller, but also for all Malaysia Airports’ clients and business partners.",1991,$1B+,1000000001,https://www.linkedin.com/company/malaysia-airports,21 years,8 years,"5,001 - 10,000 employees",norhaya@malaysiaairports.com.my,norhaya,malaysiaairports.com.my,safe,98,true,true,false,false,true,alt1.aspmx.l.google.com; alt3.aspmx.l.google.com; alt2.aspmx.l.google.com; alt4.aspmx.l.google.com; aspmx.l.google.com,true,false,false,true,false,false,false

It is the only private company ever to return a spacecraft from low-Earth orbit, which it first accomplished in December 2010. The company made history again in May 2012 when its Dragon spacecraft attached to the International Space Station, exchanged cargo payloads, and returned safely to Earth — a technically challenging feat previously accomplished only by governments. Since then Dragon has delivered cargo to and from the space station multiple times, providing regular cargo resupply missions for NASA.

The company manages a network of nine airports in South Africa, including the three main international gateways of O.R. Tambo International, Cape Town International and King Shaka International Airports. In 2012, the nine airports facilitated nearly 36 million passengers.

In 2006, Airports Company South Africa formed part of a consortium that took over the expansion and management of Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport in Mumbai, India.

SpaceX has gained worldwide attention for a series of historic milestones. It is the only private company ever to return a spacecraft from low-Earth orbit, which it first accomplished in December 2010. The company made history again in May 2012 when its Dragon spacecraft attached to the International Space Station, exchanged cargo payloads, and returned safely to Earth — a technically challenging feat previously accomplished only by governments. Since then Dragon has delivered cargo to and from the space station multiple times, providing regular cargo resupply missions for NASA.

Over the years, the company has transformed a fragmented, infrastructural parastatal into a focused, customer driven, efficient and commercially successful business. The company manages a network of nine airports in South Africa, including the three main international gateways of O.R. Tambo International, Cape Town International and King Shaka International Airports. In 2012, the nine airports facilitated nearly 36 million passengers.

In 2006, Airports Company South Africa formed part of a consortium that took over the expansion and management of Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport in Mumbai, India. The success of this venture encouraged the Company’s Commercial Services division to seek similar opportunities elsewhere.

The company manages a network of nine airports in South Africa, including the three main international gateways of O.R. Tambo International, Cape Town International and King Shaka International Airports. In 2012, the nine airports facilitated nearly 36 million passengers.

In 2006, Airports Company South Africa formed part of a consortium that took over the expansion and management of Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport in Mumbai, India.

Such undertakings allow the leveraging of the pool of skills and experience amassed over the years to grow the business and increase shareholder value.

Airports Company South Africa, in partnership with the Brazilian company, Invepar, was successful in a bid to manage the development, maintenance and operations of Guarulhos International Airport in São Paulo, Brazil.

In addition to flight training and charter services the club provided other sporting facilities such as a golf course, horse riding school and skeet shooting range. It was regarded as one of the most prestigious institutions in the country as evidenced by its members which comprised of almost all the elite families in Pakistan, senior government functionaries, foreign attaches and senior executives of multinational companies. Many of these members owned their own aircraft which were maintained and serviced by the club.

Founded in 2012 on the premise of automation and engineering expertise, Cubatic Technology is already recognized for innovative solutions to unique and complex processes. With our customer-focused approach, we turn concepts into reality, from design to prototype to pilot-line manufacturing.

OUR TEAM
We deliver custom-engineered designs with direct focus on manufacturability. The result is reflected in the rapid transition from concept to scalable prototypes. Our engineering design team members all have deep roots in the Silicon Valley high-tech infrastructure with experience and backgrounds ranging from doctorates at Stanford University to engineering design and program management at companies such as Applied Materials, JDSU and Varian.

Conveniently located in the San Francisco Bay Area, our automation and engineering design company is ready to provide customized manufacturing solutions for emerging technologies and markets such as EV/Battery and Solar. All of these require nontraditional automation design approaches for which our expertise is uniquely suited.

Our mission is to provide pilot-line and NPI-oriented automation and engineering solutions. We work closely with our clients to integrate application-specific designs that can be scalable, modular, or flexible for upgrades or expansion.

Contact us today with your greatest project challenges. We welcome the opportunity to earn your trust and become your preferred partner.

On the wave of the oil boom of the 1940s, a national carrier was born in 1954. Initially, Kuwait Airways Company served a limited network of Basra, Abadan, Beirut, Damascus and Jerusalem; however, a year later the fledgling carrier was facing economic hardship, and the government of Kuwait took a 50% interest in the airline, subsequently doubling the company's capital. Having entered the rough and tumble world of aviation, the government finally took 100% share in Kuwait Airways.
 
Kuwait Airways entered the jet age in 1962 by leasing a Comet 4-C, the world's first jet-engined airliner. In the 1960s, the national carrier rapidly expanded its route map, and scheduled services to London began three times a week. To keep pace with fast-moving aviation requirements, three Boeing 707s were delivered in 1968. Ten years later, Kuwait Airways had an all Boeing 707 fleet of eight aircraft. 
 
In 1978, Kuwait Airways entered the wide-body age by taking delivery of its first two B747-200s, adding a third the following year. This expansion permitted Kuwait Airways to extend its network to New York to the west and Manila to the east. 
Modernization of the fleet continued, and four B727-200s were delivered in 1980-1981. Two years later, eight Airbus A310s and A300-600s were delivered, and in 1986 three Boeing 767-200ER aircraft joined the wide-body fleet.
 
Following the destruction of its premises and 15 of its aircraft during the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, the airline was relaunched. Moreover, the company was restored after the Liberation of Kuwait, and a basic strategy was constituted to expand its operations around the world. After the Liberation of Kuwait until 1998, the Kuwaiti Airways fleet consisted of 17 aircraft.
 
In 2016, the airline was formally registered as a private company and its Corporate identity was rebranded to reflect its modernization and transformation.",1954,$1M - $5M,2500000,https://www.linkedin.com/company/kuwait-airways,20 years,3 years,"10,001+ employees",broxas@kuwaitairways.com,broxas,kuwaitairways.com,safe,98,true,true,false,false,true,asc-me-mx2.titanhq.com; asc-me-mx1.titanhq.com,true,false,false,true,false,false,false

On the wave of the oil boom of the 1940s, a national carrier was born in 1954. Initially, Kuwait Airways Company served a limited network of Basra, Abadan, Beirut, Damascus and Jerusalem; however, a year later the fledgling carrier was facing economic hardship, and the government of Kuwait took a 50% interest in the airline, subsequently doubling the company's capital. Having entered the rough and tumble world of aviation, the government finally took 100% share in Kuwait Airways.
 
Kuwait Airways entered the jet age in 1962 by leasing a Comet 4-C, the world's first jet-engined airliner. In the 1960s, the national carrier rapidly expanded its route map, and scheduled services to London began three times a week. To keep pace with fast-moving aviation requirements, three Boeing 707s were delivered in 1968. Ten years later, Kuwait Airways had an all Boeing 707 fleet of eight aircraft. 
 
In 1978, Kuwait Airways entered the wide-body age by taking delivery of its first two B747-200s, adding a third the following year. This expansion permitted Kuwait Airways to extend its network to New York to the west and Manila to the east. 
Modernization of the fleet continued, and four B727-200s were delivered in 1980-1981. Two years later, eight Airbus A310s and A300-600s were delivered, and in 1986 three Boeing 767-200ER aircraft joined the wide-body fleet.
 
Following the destruction of its premises and 15 of its aircraft during the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, the airline was relaunched. Moreover, the company was restored after the Liberation of Kuwait, and a basic strategy was constituted to expand its operations around the world. After the Liberation of Kuwait until 1998, the Kuwaiti Airways fleet consisted of 17 aircraft.
 
In 2016, the airline was formally registered as a private company and its Corporate identity was rebranded to reflect its modernization and transformation.",1954,$1M - $5M,2500000,https://www.linkedin.com/company/kuwait-airways,26 years,7 years,"10,001+ employees",kwid9ku@kuwaitairways.com,kwid9ku,kuwaitairways.com,safe,98,true,true,false,false,true,asc-me-mx2.titanhq.com; asc-me-mx1.titanhq.com,true,false,false,true,false,false,false

As one of the school’s first students and still a keen pilot himself, Sheik Saleh continues to promote and support interest and knowledge of the Aviation Industry to aspiring pilots.

Over the first twenty years Fujairah Aviation Academy has provided professional aviation education for students requiring the Private Pilots License and the Commercial Pilots License. With the emergence of the United Arab Emirates as a world class business centre bringing innovation, expertise and technology to the region, we enter into our third decade being proud to introduce an Academy of Aviation Excellence in the form of the first dedicated Airline Transport Pilots License School in the Middle East.

All of the Fujairah Aviation Academy’s courses are approved by the UAE GCAA, and upon successful completion, result in the issue of a UAE licence. The UAE is a member of International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). Licences issued by the UAE are convertible to the licences of other ICAO states, subject to their civil aviation regulations.

Why Fujairah for Flight Training?

The Fujairah International Airport is ideally located for flight training. Following are some of its advantages:

• No waiting for taxi clearance, no holding or orbiting.
• Un-restricted takeoffs and landings.
• Training area is located only five minutes flight time after take off.
• Open seven days a week.

• Airfield is equipped with NDB/VOR/DME/ILS and Radar navigation facilities.
• Air Traffic Control, Met and Flight Briefing available 24 hours.
• Quiet environment is conducive to learning.
