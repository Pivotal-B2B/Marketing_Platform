Let’s proceed in stages. I’ll outline the foundation plan below and then we can iterate field-by-field and UX-by-UX, similar to how we did for Contacts and Accounts.

17.0 Lists & Segmentation Engine
17.1 Purpose

The Lists & Segmentation engine enables users to create, manage, and reuse audience definitions across the platform.
It serves three main purposes:

Define target audiences for campaigns (email, telemarketing, ABM).

Support data operations (bulk exports, QA sampling, enrichment).

Enable analytics segmentation for engagement and performance metrics.

17.2 Core Concepts
Concept	Description
Segment (Dynamic)	A saved query definition (rule-based). Evaluated dynamically every time it’s used.
List (Static)	A snapshot of contacts/accounts at the time of creation. Does not change automatically.
Domain Set	A subset of Accounts or Contacts created from an uploaded list of domains (for ABM programs).
Combined Audience	The union/intersection of Lists and Segments, created ad hoc for campaign selection.
17.3 Data Model

Segment

id

name

record_count_cache

entity_type

source_type (segment | manual_upload | selection)

source_ref (Segment ID or import ID)

snapshot_ts

record_ids[]

created_by

tags[]

visibility_scope

17.4 Filter Categories

The segmentation builder supports nested AND/OR logic, with field categorization for discoverability and scalability.
Filters dynamically populate based on available fields and custom fields defined in schema registry.

A. Contact Fields

Full Name, Job Title, Email, Phone, Department, Seniority, City, State, Country,
Email Verification Status, Intent Topics, LinkedIn URL, Created Date, Owner, Custom Fields…

B. Account Fields

Company Name, Domain, Industry (verified + AI), Employee Size, Annual Revenue,
HQ Country, Region, LinkedIn URL, Technologies Installed, Specialties, Custom Fields…

C. Suppression Fields

Email Suppressed (True/False), DNC Flag, Unsubscribed Date, Suppression Source.

D. Email Campaign Metrics

Campaign Name, Sent (True/False), Delivered, Opened, Clicked, Not Sent,
Not Opened, Not Clicked, Soft Bounce, Hard Bounce, Never Bounced, Last Engaged Date.

E. Telemarketing Campaign Metrics

Campaign Name, Caller Name, Call Disposition, Call Comments,
Qualifying Question Responses, Call Date & Time, Call Duration.

F. QA Fields

QA Status (In Review, Accepted, Rejected), QA Reviewer, QA Comments, Rejection Reason.

G. List / Segment Membership

Included in List (multi-select), Not Included in List,
Included in Segment, Not Included in Segment.

H. Client Portal Fields

Client Delivered, Client Accepted, Client Rejected, Client Comments, Client Name.

17.5 Operators Supported
Type	Operators
String/Text	equals, not equals, contains, not contains, starts with, ends with, regex
Number	equals, greater than, less than, between
Boolean	is true, is false
Date/Time	before, after, within last X days
List/Array	includes any, includes all, excludes
Nullables	is empty, is not empty, has value
17.6 UX & Interaction

Visual Query Builder (No-Code)

Drag-and-drop condition blocks, AND/OR grouping.

Autocomplete field search.

Live preview count (via async query to index).

Saved Views and Templates (e.g., “Marketing Decision Makers in UK”).

Advanced Mode (Power Users)

JSON editor for complex queries.

Validation and syntax highlighting.

Re-usable via API endpoints.

Segmentation Dashboard

Columns: Name, Type (Contact/Account), Count, Creator, Last Updated, Tags.

Actions: Duplicate, Export, Convert to List, Delete.

List Dashboard

Columns: Name, Source Type, Created Date, Record Count.

Actions: Export CSV, Add to Campaign, Add to Suppression, Merge, Delete.

17.7 Performance & Scalability

Real-time preview powered by OpenSearch indexes.

Large queries paginated and cached.

Dynamic filter generation (from schema registry) ensures new fields appear automatically everywhere (Contacts, Accounts, Campaigns, Client Portal).

Indexing strategy:

Contact index includes flattened Account fields for cross-entity filters.

Incremental re-index jobs triggered on entity updates.

Full refresh nightly or on schema change.

17.8 Bulk Operations

Supported actions (based on selection/filter context):

Add to existing List

Create new List and add selected

Export selected (CSV/XLSX)

Assign Owner / Update Field (bulk edit)

Bulk Delete (soft delete + undo window)

Supports per-page and select all matching filter actions.

Operations queued for async execution with progress bar & notifications.

17.9 API Endpoints (Illustrative)

POST /segments — create a segment

GET /segments/:id/preview — live count preview

POST /lists — create static list (from segment/filter)

POST /lists/:id/export — export CSV

POST /bulk/update — bulk edit

POST /bulk/delete — soft delete

POST /bulk/add-to-list — mass add selected to list

GET /segments/schema — get filterable field definitions (from registry)

17.10 AI & Automation Extensions

AI Smart Segmentation: Suggest filters based on intent, ICP, or past campaign engagement.

Lookalike Segment Generation: AI analyzes high-performing segments and recommends similar profiles.

Segment Quality Scoring: Evaluate data completeness and engagement potential.

Natural Language Query Builder: “Show me all CFOs in the UK who opened any HR campaign last month.”
