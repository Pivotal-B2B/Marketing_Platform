MessageBundle: id, audience_hint (industry/persona), problem, value_prop, proof_points[], cta_text, tone, status (draft|approved|published).

LandingPage: id, bundle_id, sections_json, form_schema, html_export_uri, published_url?.

EmailTemplate: id, bundle_id, html, placeholders[], variants[], approved_by, approved_at.

Experiment: id, scope (email|lp), variants[], allocation, start_at, end_at, winner?.

PublishingLink: { bundle_id | lp_id | email_template_id } ↔ { campaign_id }, with version pinning.

19.4 APIs (Illustrative)

GET /content/experiments/:id/results

POST /content/approve (workflow actions)

19.5 AI Stack & Guardrails

Models: Long‑context LLM for analysis/composition; small classifiers for risk & tone; retrieval over uploaded assets with chunked citations.

Prompts: Structured templates require: audience, problem, value, proof, CTA.

Controls: Max‑quote limits; citation anchors; blocked terms library; region‑specific policy packs; reversible edits with full diff history.
