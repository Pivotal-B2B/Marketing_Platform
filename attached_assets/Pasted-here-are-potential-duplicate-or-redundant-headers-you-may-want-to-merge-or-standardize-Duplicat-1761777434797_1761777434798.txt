here are potential duplicate or redundant headers you may want to merge or standardize:

⚠️ Duplicate or Overlapping Header Groups
1. Contact Address Fields

Contact Address 1

Contact Address 2

Contact Address 3

Contact City

Contact State

Contact Country

Contact Postal Code

➡️ These overlap with:

Contact Custom: custom_cav_addr1

Contact Custom: custom_cav_addr2

Contact Custom: custom_cav_addr3

Contact Custom: custom_cav_town

Contact Custom: custom_cav_state

Contact Custom: custom_cav_postcode

Contact Custom: custom_cav_tel

✅ Suggestion: Keep one standardized set (preferably the non-custom “Contact …” version) and map the custom fields to it.

2. HQ / Account Address Fields

HQ Address 1

HQ Address 2

HQ Address 3

HQ City

HQ State

HQ Country

HQ Postal Code

Account HQ Street 1

Account HQ Street 2

Account City

Account State

Account Country

Account Postal Code

➡️ These clearly duplicate each other.

✅ Suggestion: Keep only one complete set — preferably the Account … version since it aligns with your CRM account object.

3. Phone Numbers

Phone

Mobile

Account Phone

HQ Phone

Contact Custom: custom_cav_tel

➡️ All refer to different but possibly overlapping contact vs account numbers.

✅ Suggestion: Consolidate into:

Contact Phone
Contact Mobile
Account Phone

4. Company Information

Account Name

Account Domain

Account Industry

Account Size

Account Revenue

Contact Custom: custom_company_annual_revenue

Contact Custom: custom_company_industry

Contact Custom: custom_company_revenue_range

Contact Custom: custom_company_staff_count_range

Contact Custom: custom_company_location

Contact Custom: custom_company_description

➡️ The “Contact Custom: custom_company_…” fields mirror account-level attributes.

✅ Suggestion: Merge them into unified account attributes.

5. Position / Tenure Fields

Time in Current Position

Time in Current Position (Months)

Time in Current Company

Time in Current Company (Months)

Contact Custom: custom_time_in_current_company

Contact Custom: custom_time_in_current_position

✅ Suggestion: Keep numeric month-based versions and map the custom ones into them.

6. Email Fields

Email

Email Lower

Contact Custom: custom_email_1_validation

✅ Suggestion: Keep Email and add Email Validation Status if needed — Email Lower can be auto-generated.
