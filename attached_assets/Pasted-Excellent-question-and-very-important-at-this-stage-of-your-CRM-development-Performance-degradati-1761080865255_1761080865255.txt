Excellent question ‚Äî and very important at this stage of your CRM development. Performance degradation after large data uploads (thousands or millions of records) is one of the most common scaling issues in CRM systems like yours (React + Node + PostgreSQL).

Let‚Äôs go step-by-step so you can diagnose, fix, and permanently optimize performance.

‚∏ª

‚öôÔ∏è 1. Identify Where the Slowness Occurs

You need to isolate which layer is slowing down:

Layer	Common Symptoms	Diagnostic Action
Frontend (React)	Slow rendering, freezes when displaying large tables	Check React profiler, inspect pagination and state updates
Backend (Node.js / Express)	API requests take seconds/minutes	Measure API latency with morgan or pino logger
Database (PostgreSQL)	Queries become slow, CPU spikes	Run EXPLAIN ANALYZE on slow queries, inspect indexes


‚∏ª

üöÄ 2. Optimize Database (Most Critical)

‚úÖ Use Proper Indexing

Create indexes for frequently filtered or joined fields:

CREATE INDEX idx_contacts_email ON contacts(email);
CREATE INDEX idx_contacts_company_id ON contacts(company_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_company_name_trgm ON accounts USING gin (name gin_trgm_ops);

Use pg_trgm extension for fuzzy text search (Singapore Airlines vs Singapore Airlines Ltd).

‚úÖ Batch Inserts (not one-by-one)

When uploading CSVs, insert data in chunks (e.g., 500‚Äì1000 rows at once) using:

await db.insert(contacts).values(batch).onConflictDoNothing();

‚úÖ Use LIMIT + OFFSET or cursor-based pagination

Never fetch all data at once ‚Äî use infinite scroll or server-side pagination.

‚úÖ Background Jobs for Heavy Tasks

Offload heavy work (email validation, enrichment, suppression matching, etc.) to a queue worker (e.g., BullMQ, node-cron, or worker_threads).

‚∏ª

üß† 3. Optimize Backend (Node.js / Express)

‚úÖ Use Connection Pooling

Use a single database pool:

import { Pool } from "pg";
export const pool = new Pool({ max: 10 });

‚úÖ Enable Response Compression

import compression from 'compression';
app.use(compression());

‚úÖ Cache Frequent Queries

Use Redis or in-memory caching for repetitive lookups like companies, job titles, or campaign configurations.

‚úÖ Asynchronous Data Processing

When uploading, respond immediately with ‚ÄúUpload started‚Ä¶‚Äù then process asynchronously via background queue.

‚∏ª

üíª 4. Optimize Frontend (React)

‚úÖ Virtualized Tables

For large contact lists, use React Virtualized or TanStack Table with virtualization ‚Äî only render visible rows, not all at once.

‚úÖ Use Query Caching (TanStack Query)

Cache server responses and avoid refetching identical data.

‚úÖ Lazy Load Components

Use React‚Äôs lazy() and Suspense for large modules like analytics dashboards.

‚∏ª

üß© 5. File Upload & Parsing Optimization
	‚Ä¢	Use stream-based parsing (e.g., fast-csv or Papa Parse in chunk mode)
	‚Ä¢	Avoid loading the entire CSV into memory.
	‚Ä¢	Example:

fs.createReadStream('file.csv')
  .pipe(parse({ headers: true }))
  .on('data', async (row) => {
     batch.push(row);
     if (batch.length >= 1000) { await insertBatch(batch); batch = []; }
  });


‚∏ª

‚òÅÔ∏è 6. Infrastructure-Level Improvements

Optimization	Description
Upgrade DB Hosting	Use Neon/Postgres with higher IOPS or move to AWS RDS
CDN & Caching	Serve static assets via Cloudflare/AWS CloudFront
Horizontal Scaling	Deploy backend on multiple Node instances behind a load balancer
Monitor with APM	Use tools like Datadog, New Relic, or PM2 metrics to trace bottlenecks


‚∏ª

üìà 7. Performance Benchmarks to Target

Operation	Target
Upload 100K contacts	‚â§ 3 minutes (chunked background process)
Dashboard load	‚â§ 1.5 seconds
Filtered query (with indexes)	‚â§ 200 ms
API response	‚â§ 500 ms


‚∏ª

üß∞ Recommended Stack Upgrades
	‚Ä¢	Queue & background jobs: BullMQ or Redis Queue
	‚Ä¢	Caching: Redis
	‚Ä¢	Profiling: PM2 + clinic.js or autocannon
	‚Ä¢	Database optimization: pgTune + auto vacuum tuning
	‚Ä¢	Frontend performance monitoring: React Profiler + Lighthouse

If you want, I can generate a Replit implementation prompt to apply these optimizations directly to your current Pivotal CRM architecture (React + Node + PostgreSQL + Drizzle).
Would you like me to write that next?
