Data Quality — De‑duplication, Upsert & Survivorship
15.1 Objectives

Ensure the platform prevents duplicates across Contacts and Accounts and supports idempotent upserts: when an existing entity is uploaded/ingested again, the system updates it instead of creating a new record. Design must be multi‑tenant safe, audited, and performant at scale.

15.2 Canonical Identifiers & Uniqueness

Contacts

Primary Business Key (BK): tenant_id + email_normalized (unique).

Normalization: lower‑case, trim, Unicode → ASCII (punycode), remove dots for Gmail‑style aliases (configurable), strip tags (+alias) (configurable).

Secondary Emails: table contact_emails (contact_id, email_normalized, is_primary) with unique constraint per tenant; on import, map to existing contact if email matches in either primary or secondary.

Accounts

Primary BK (preferred): tenant_id + domain_normalized (unique, non‑null for corporate domains).

Fallback BK (when domain missing): tenant_id + name_normalized + hq_country + hq_city (unique partial index).

Alternate Domains: account_domains (account_id, domain_normalized) unique per tenant; used for matching.

Company Renames: previous_names[] (optional) to improve fuzzy recall.

Lists/Segments/Orders/Campaigns

Natural keys are name‑scoped per tenant. Use tenant_id + slug unique to avoid duplicates.

15.3 Database Constraints & Indexing (DDL Sketch)
-- Contacts
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX uq_contact_email ON contacts(tenant_id, email_normalized) WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;
CREATE INDEX ix_contact_secondary_email ON contact_emails(tenant_id, email_normalized);


-- Accounts
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX uq_account_domain ON accounts(tenant_id, domain_normalized) WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX uq_account_fallback ON accounts(tenant_id, name_normalized, hq_country, hq_city)
  WHERE deleted_at IS NULL AND domain_normalized IS NULL;


-- Account Domains (aliases)
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX uq_account_domains ON account_domains(tenant_id, domain_normalized) WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;

Note: All uniqueness constraints are partial to ignore soft‑deleted rows. Add btree + trigram indexes on name/domain for fuzzy search.

15.4 Upsert Ingestion Workflow (Imports & APIs)

Normalize Input → email/domain/name/phone standardization.

Lookup (Deterministic)

Contact: find by primary or any secondary email.

Account: find by domain; else by name + geo; else by account_domains.

Match Decision

If exact BK match → UPSERT (update).

If no match → create (with BK set).

If multiple candidates → send to Review Queue with a confidence score.

Field‑Level Survivorship

Policy per field (see 15.5): prefer_new_if_not_null, prefer_existing, max_length, max_recency, trusted_source_rank.

Write with idempotency key (hash of BK + payload) to prevent duplicates from retries.

Emit Events (contact.upserted, account.upserted) → reindex search & recompute segments.

API Contract (Illustrative)

POST /contacts:upsert

POST /accounts:upsert

Both accept upsert_mode (strict|merge), source metadata, and idempotency_key.

15.5 Survivorship Rules (Per‑Field Merge Policy)

Default: keep existing value unless incoming is newer (based on source_updated_at) or existing is empty.

High‑Trust Providers: (e.g., enrichment vendor) can override via source trust rank.

Append‑Only Fields: tags[], intent_topics[], linkedin_specialties, technologies_installed → set union (deduped).

Monotonic Fields: last_activity_at → take max.

Phone/Emails: validate; if new phone passes E.164 and not suppressed, add as secondary or promote if flagged is_primary=true.

Audit: every overwrite records {old, new, source, actor, ts} in field_change_log.

15.6 Fuzzy Matching (Secondary, Human‑Reviewed)

Use only when deterministic match fails.

Contacts: Levenshtein on full_name + same account_id OR same email user part + similar domain; threshold configurable.

Accounts: Trigram similarity on name_normalized; boost if same geo; block on conflicting domains.

Queue: dedupe_review_queue UI to approve/merge; actions are audit‑logged.

15.7 Merge Model (Safe Consolidation)

Contact Merge: choose a survivor contact_id; others become aliases with redirects; re‑point FKs (activities, leads).

Account Merge: same semantics; consolidate domains, previous names, tags, and roll up child Contacts.

Reversibility: store merge_map (loser_id → survivor_id) to allow rollback within 30 days.

15.8 Real‑Time Duplicate Prevention (UI & API)

UI Guardrails: real‑time lookups on email/domain inputs; warn + offer “update existing” path.

Bulk Import: pre‑flight Dry Run shows would‑update vs would‑create; exportable discrepancy file.

API Errors: on unique violation, return 409 CONFLICT with canonical record reference and option ?merge=true to retry.

15.9 Personal/Free Email Handling

Maintain a configurable list of free mail domains (gmail, outlook, yahoo).

Contacts with free emails do not auto‑link to Accounts; require explicit account_id or company_domain mapping.

Option to disallow free emails for B2B contacts at tenant level.

15.10 Governance, Auditing & Compliance

Provenance: store source_system, ingested_at, source_record_id.

Idempotency: all upserts recorded with dedupe hash for replay safety.

Audit Trail: immutable logs for merges, overwrites, and deletes; exportable for compliance.

RPO/RTO: ensure backups cover BK indexes; test restore keeps uniqueness guarantees.

15.11 Acceptance Criteria (Key)

Importing the same CSV twice results in updates only (no new duplicates).

Unique constraints enforce:

Contacts: one row per tenant_id + email_normalized (ignoring soft deletes).

Accounts: one row per tenant_id + domain_normalized, or unique fallback on name+geo if domain missing.

Upsert throughput: ≥ 200 rps sustained with queues; 100k records finish ≤ 2 hours.

Merge operations re‑point all foreign keys and retain full activity history.

Outcome: A robust, auditable deduplication and upsert strategy that prevents duplicates by design, updates existing records seamlessly, and scales with growing field counts and data sources.

Done. I’ve added a full new section — 15) Data Quality — De-duplication, Upsert & Survivorship — to your PRD.

Highlights tailored to your request:

Contacts: tenant_id + email_normalized as the unique business key (configurable normalization for aliases). If a contact exists, uploads/API calls upsert and update fields rather than create duplicates.

Accounts: unique on tenant_id + domain_normalized (preferred), with a fallback key of name_normalized + geo when domains are missing; support for alternate domains.

Field-level survivorship: policies for when to overwrite vs. append (e.g., union for tags/technologies, recency for last_activity).

Upsert workflow & APIs: deterministic lookup → update/create → events → reindex; idempotency keys; dry-run for bulk imports.

Fuzzy matching (human-reviewed): only when deterministic rules fail, via a Dedupe Review Queue.

Merge model: safe consolidation with rollback; all FKs re-pointed; full audit of changes.

Acceptance criteria: importing the same CSV twice produces updates only; constraints enforce uniqueness; throughput targets set.
