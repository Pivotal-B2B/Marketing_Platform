JS SDK Demo App
To lower onboarding barrier, a JS SDK demo app was built and made accessible at webrtc.telnyx.com.

To use it, complete the following procedure.

Instead of portal.telnyx.com screenshots being displayed, only API requests are presented, as frequent UI improvements render this page out of date.

Sign up and top up the account with a small amount of credit, e.g. $5.

}

where the outbound_voice_profile_id is the id returned in the previous API request.

    }
  ],
  "connection_id": "2532747013766776351"
}

The order will be pending in the immediate response. After a short wait, poll the order status.

Follow this instruction to create a telephony credential.

The demo app should have the following configuration

“Authentication” → “Credential”
“SIP Username” → from telephony credential
“Password” → from telephony credential
“Caller ID Name” → purchased phone number in +E164 format
“Caller ID Number” → purchased phone number in +E164 format
After clicking “Connect”, you should see registered in the log to the right.

To make an outbound call, put the destination phone number in +E164 format. Ensure the destination country is in the whitelisted_destinations of the configured OVP.

Open another tab and successfully register another client. From that client, dial [xxx]@sip.telnyx.com where xxx is the sip_username of the telephony credential of the first client. It starts with gencred.



Alternatively, register this client with the credentials of the SIP connection created earlier. You may dial the phone number directly from your mobile device.
