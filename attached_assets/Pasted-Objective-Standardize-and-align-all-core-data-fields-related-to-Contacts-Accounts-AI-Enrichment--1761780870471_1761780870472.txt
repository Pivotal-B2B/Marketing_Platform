Objective

Standardize and align all core data fields related to Contacts, Accounts, AI Enrichment, and Smart Templates across the entire platform.

Ensure consistency across UI, filters, CSV uploads, exports, field mapping, and data enrichment logic, while maintaining backward compatibility and avoiding any conflict with existing schema or system-generated fields.

🧠 Core Implementation Rules

System-generated fields (id, uuid, system_status, created_at, updated_at, etc.) must remain unchanged.

Replace legacy or duplicate fields with standardized field names listed below.

Maintain backward compatibility using alias mapping (old_field → new_field) in the database schema or data migration layer.

Apply uniform logic and naming conventions across:

Frontend (React UI components + filters)

CSV Imports & Exports

API Endpoints

Verification Campaigns & Call Campaigns

QA Console & Enrichment Jobs

Background Queues and Worker Processes

Database Models (Drizzle ORM)

Ensure all platform modules — including Contacts, Accounts, AI Enrichment, Smart Templates, QA Console, and Verification Campaigns — use unified field definitions.

🧩 1. CONTACT INFORMATION
Field Name	Description
CAV_ID	Unique Contact Verification Identifier (links contact record to verification campaign record)
CAV_User_ID	Agent / Verifier User ID who processed this contact
full_name	Combined first + last name
first_name	Contact given name
Email_Address	Primary business email address
last_name	Contact surname
job_title	Contact’s professional title
linkedin_url	Contact LinkedIn profile
time_in_current_position_months	Duration in current position (in months)
time_in_current_company_months	Duration in current company (in months)
Contact_Phone	Primary office phone
Contact_Mobile	Direct mobile number

✅ Implementation Notes:

Maintain historical mapping for legacy fields (e.g., email → Email_Address).

Auto-generate full_name by concatenating first_name + last_name at import or display time.

📍 2. CONTACT ADDRESS FIELDS
Field Name	Description
contact_street_1	Primary street address
contact_street_2	Secondary address line
contact_street_3	Optional line (e.g., suite / floor)
contact_city	City
contact_state	Full state or province name
contact_state_abbr	Shortened state abbreviation (e.g., CA, NY)
contact_postal_code	Zip or postal code
contact_country	Country name
contact_location_snap	Combined full address (AI-generated all-in-one line)

✅ Implementation Notes:

All UI inputs, CSV uploads, and validation rules should apply only to these standardized fields.

Legacy custom_cav_ address fields must map automatically through import mapping.

🏢 3. ACCOUNT / HQ ADDRESS FIELDS
Field Name	Description
account_name	Official company name
account_domain	Verified company website or domain
account_hq_street_1	HQ address line 1
account_hq_street_2	HQ address line 2
account_hq_street_3	HQ address line 3
account_city	HQ city
account_state	HQ state (full name)
account_state_abbr	HQ state abbreviation
account_postal_code	HQ postal / zip code
account_country	HQ country
account_location_snap	Combined HQ address (AI formatted)
account_hq_phone	Main HQ phone number

✅ Implementation Notes:

All account-level fields must be unified across accounts, verification_accounts, and enrichment_accounts tables.

CSV exports must include contact + HQ address + AI + Best address blocks consistently in the same order.

🏭 4. COMPANY INFORMATION
Field Name	Description
account_industry	Primary industry classification
account_employee_size_range	Employee size range (e.g., “51–200”)
account_revenue	Annual revenue (numeric)
account_revenue_range	Revenue bracket (text e.g., “$10M–$50M”)
account_description	Short company overview or profile
account_founded_date	Year or date founded
account_li_profile_url	LinkedIn company profile URL
naics_code	North American Industry Classification code
sic_code	Standard Industry Classification code
account_min_employee_size	Numeric minimum employee count
account_max_employee_size	Numeric maximum employee count

✅ Implementation Notes:

All company-level data must use snake_case naming in the backend.

Sync account_industry, naics_code, and sic_code across AI enrichment and QA verification systems.

Ensure revenue and employee size ranges are normalized to consistent units.

🤖 5. AI ENRICHMENT FIELDS
Field Name	Description
address_enrichment_status	pending / enriched / verified
phone_enrichment_status	pending / enriched / verified
ai_address_confidence	Address confidence score (0–100%)
ai_phone_confidence	Phone confidence score (0–100%)
ai_enriched_phone	Enriched or corrected phone number
ai_enriched_street_1	Enriched address line 1
ai_enriched_street_2	Enriched address line 2
ai_enriched_street_3	Enriched address line 3
ai_enriched_city	Enriched city
ai_enriched_state	Enriched state
ai_enriched_postal_code	Enriched postal code
enrichment_source	internal / web / hybrid
last_enrichment_run	Timestamp of last AI enrichment
ai_industry_classification_overview	AI-generated company sector summary
ai_account_keywords	AI-detected key terms from company description or website

✅ Implementation Notes:

Automatically overwrite only if confidence ≥ 70%.

Maintain a change log (enrichment_audit) for traceability.

Original imported data must remain stored as the baseline record.

💡 6. SMART TEMPLATE — BEST ADDRESS & PHONE
Field Name	Description
best_address_line_1, best_address_line_2, best_address_line_3	Auto-selected best available address from enriched, verified, or imported sources
best_city	Most confident or validated city
best_state	Most confident or validated state
best_postal_code	Most accurate postal code
best_phone_number	AI-selected best phone number (priority: enriched > mobile > contact > account, matched to contact country)

✅ Implementation Notes:

Smart Template logic populates these dynamically for exports, campaign previews, or data views.

These are non-editable computed fields refreshed during enrichment or QA processing.

🔁 Strategic Integration Scope
Applies To

Database Schema (contacts, accounts, verification_contacts, ai_enrichment)

Frontend UI (React + Tailwind + shadcn components)

Filter Builders & Query System

Bulk Imports & CSV Field Mapping

Exports (QA Reports, Deliverables, Campaign Outputs)

Enrichment & Verification Jobs

QA Console, Smart Templates, and Campaign Builders

Testing & QA Checklist

✅ Validate consistent field display names in all UI forms and components.

✅ Verify CSV imports auto-map old → new field names correctly.

✅ Ensure CSV and XLSX exports reflect standardized column names.

✅ Test AI enrichment updates only standardized mapped fields.

✅ Confirm Smart Template dynamically resolves best_* fields.

✅ Validate data integrity in production without loss of historical data.

✅ Ensure verification and QA dashboards reflect updated naming conventions.
