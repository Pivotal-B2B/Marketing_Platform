22) Menu & Navigation Architecture (Simplified & Scalable)

22.1 Objectives
	•	Deliver a clean, intuitive, and role-based navigation experience.
	•	Reduce menu clutter by nesting specialized utilities (Segments, Lists, Domain Sets, Bulk Imports) within their parent contexts.
	•	Standardize a collapsible left sidebar with logical grouping, consistent icons, and adaptive visibility by user role (Admin, Manager, Agent, QA, Client).
	•	Maintain easy expansion for future modules like Content Hub or Integrations.

22.5 Design Behavior

	•	Notifications (task updates, campaign status)
	•	User menu (Profile, Preferences, Logout)
	•	Breadcrumbs on all views for quick back navigation.

22.6 UX Rationale
	1.	Decluttered Navigation: Reduces top-level items from 12+ to 7.
	2.	Contextual Utilities: Segments, Lists, Imports live where users need them.
	3.	Better Cognitive Flow: “Accounts → Domain Sets → Campaigns” aligns with ABM logic.
	4.	Role Adaptability: Client users and Agents see only relevant tools.
	5.	Future-Proof: Supports Content Hub, AI Modules, or Integrations via one expandable “Organization Settings” category.
