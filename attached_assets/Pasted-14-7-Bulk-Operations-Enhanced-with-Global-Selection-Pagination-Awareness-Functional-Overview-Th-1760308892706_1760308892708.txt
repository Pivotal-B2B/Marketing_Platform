14.7 Bulk Operations (Enhanced with Global Selection & Pagination Awareness)
Functional Overview

The bulk-action system must support large-scale selection and actions across paginated data sets, preserving all selected records that meet current filters and search criteria, not just those visible on the active page.

Selection Capabilities

Page-Level Selection

Users can select individual records or “Select All on This Page” (e.g., 50 records per page).

Checkboxes remain sticky when navigating between pages until cleared or actioned.

Global Selection (Across All Pages)

When a filter or search query is active, the system presents a confirmation prompt:

“You’ve selected 50 records on this page. Would you like to select all 1 ,742 records that match your current filter?”

Upon confirmation, the selection expands to include all filtered results, regardless of pagination.

A server-side tokenized selection context is created (e.g., selection_id) so subsequent bulk actions operate reliably on the same result set.

Persistent Selection Context

The backend maintains selected IDs in memory / Redis for up to 15 minutes of inactivity or until the user resets.

Any change in filter or search automatically invalidates the existing selection context to prevent unintended edits.

Visual Feedback

Toolbar displays a dynamic counter (Selected 54 of 1 ,742) and a “Clear Selection” option.

When scrolling or paginating, selected rows remain highlighted for continuity.

Supported Bulk Actions

(All actions can operate on the current page or full selection context.)

Bulk Update Fields — multi-field editor with preview before applying.

Bulk Delete (Soft Delete) — confirm, audit, 30-day recovery.

Bulk Export — apply suppression rules automatically; exports entire selection if chosen.

Bulk Assign Owner — reassign in one operation with notifications.

Bulk Add to List — supports:

Add to Existing List, or

Create New List on the Fly (name, description, visibility).
Works for Accounts or Contacts and respects filter-based global selections.

Bulk Link to Campaign (Optional Phase 2.2) — assign selected Contacts to a campaign audience queue.

Technical Implementation Notes

API endpoints accept either:

explicit ids[] array (for ≤ 10 k records), or

selection_context_token representing all filtered results.

Background jobs (BullMQ) handle large-batch operations asynchronously.

Frontend state management (e.g., Redux / Zustand) stores temporary selection context for smooth UX.

Backend validation ensures user has permission on every record in bulk actions (RBAC enforced per role).

Outcome: Users can safely perform large-scale updates, list management, and exports on tens of thousands of Accounts or Contacts with confidence and full auditability — matching enterprise-grade CRM ergonomics.
