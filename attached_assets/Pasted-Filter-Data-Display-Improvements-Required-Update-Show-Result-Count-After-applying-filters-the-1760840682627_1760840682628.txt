Filter & Data Display Improvements — Required Update

Show Result Count:
After applying filters, the number of results (e.g., “Showing 248 Results”) must be clearly displayed at the top of the results section across all modules.

Missing Filter Categories:
Current filter configuration is incomplete. Please include all relevant field groups dynamically based on entity type:

Account-related fields (Industry, Size, Revenue, Location, etc.)

Campaign-related fields (Campaign Name, Campaign Type, Status, Owner, Date Range, etc.)

List / Segment-related fields (List Name, Segment Owner, Created Date, etc.)

QA-related fields (QA Status, QA Reviewer, QA Outcome, Reviewed Date, etc.)

Any other entity-linked fields related to contacts (e.g., Assigned Agent, Verification Status, Source, Campaign ID).

Standardized Dropdown Values:
All dropdowns for Contact and Company filters must use standardized values from the global template:

Seniority Levels: CXO, Director, Vice President, Manager, Non-Manager

Employee Size Bands: Must match the standard data template (e.g., 1–10, 11–50, 51–200, 201–500, 501–1,000, 1,001–5,000, 5,001–10,000, 10,000+)

Company Revenue Bands: Use the predefined global revenue ranges from the data standard (e.g., $1M–$10M, $10M–$50M, $50M–$100M, $100M+).

Industries: Use the master industry list defined in our standard data taxonomy.

Responsive UI Fixes:
The Filter interface must be fully responsive:

Dropdowns and search fields must align and resize gracefully across desktop, tablet, and mobile views.

Multi-select dropdowns should wrap selected chips and maintain consistent spacing.

Scroll and overlay behavior must be smooth and consistent in all screen sizes.

Contact & Account Details Page — Missing Data:
Many fields on both Contact Details and Account Details pages currently show as empty or hidden.

Fetch and display all available field data (including Industry, Revenue, Employee Size, Seniority, Title, Country, etc.).

Ensure all data bound to the CRM object is visible and formatted consistently with the global field template.

Add null checks and placeholder text (e.g., “—”) only when a value truly doesn’t exist.

Quality Check & Validation:

Cross-check field mappings between filter definitions and data schemas to ensure every field shows correct and complete values.

Validate dropdown value sets against the global data template to maintain consistency across modules.
