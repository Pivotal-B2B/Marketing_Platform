# Contact & Account Management Upgrade - Gap Analysis

## Executive Summary

**Current Status:** The CRM has a solid foundation with ~85% of required fields already implemented. The main gaps are in **UI/UX features**, **advanced filtering logic**, and **bulk operations** rather than data model deficiencies.

## 5. Priority Implementation Roadmap

### 🔴 **Phase 1: Critical Schema Updates** (1-2 hours)
**Goal:** Add missing fields to achieve 100% data model coverage

1. Add to Accounts:
   - `linkedin_specialties TEXT[]`
   - `parent_account_id VARCHAR FK`
   - `tags TEXT[]`
   - Create GIN indexes for array fields

2. Add to Contacts:
   - `phone_verified_at TIMESTAMP`
   - `tags TEXT[]`

3. Push schema changes: `npm run db:push`

**Deliverable:** Complete ABM-grade data model

---

### 🟠 **Phase 2: Core Linking & Relationships** (3-4 hours)
**Goal:** Enable automatic and manual account-contact linking

1. **Backend:**
   - Endpoint: `POST /api/contacts/auto-link` (domain-based matching)
   - Endpoint: `GET /api/accounts/:id/contacts`
   - Endpoint: `POST /api/contacts/:id/link-account`
   - Logic: Extract domain from email → match to accounts.domain

2. **Frontend:**
   - Account detail page with contacts table
   - "View Company" button in contact cards
   - Manual linking dialog
   - Domain match indicator

**Deliverable:** Fully linked account-contact relationships

---

### 🟡 **Phase 3: Record Detail Views** (4-6 hours)
**Goal:** Rich, navigable record pages with context

1. **Account Detail Page** (`/accounts/:id`):
   - Tabs: Overview | Contacts | Activity | Notes
   - Side panel: Industry, Domain, Tech Stack, Revenue
   - Quick actions: Edit | Merge | Add Contact | Export

2. **Contact Detail Page** (`/contacts/:id`):

1. **Filter Builder UI:**
   - Drag-and-drop filter conditions
   - AND/OR group logic
   - Cross-entity filters (Contact WHERE Account.industry = 'IT')
   - Array field support (technologies_installed CONTAINS 'Salesforce')

2. **Backend Query Engine:**
   - Dynamic SQL generation from filter JSON
   - Support for nested conditions
   - Efficient joins for cross-entity filters

3. **Filter Management:**
   - Save filter as preset
   - Share filter with team
   - Load saved filters

**Deliverable:** ABM-grade targeting precision

---

### 🔵 **Phase 5: Bulk Operations** (8-12 hours)
**Goal:** Operational efficiency for data teams

1. **Bulk Selection:**
   - Checkbox column in tables
   - Select all with pagination awareness
   - Selection counter and toolbar

2. **Bulk Actions:**
   - Update: Assign owner, change status, add tags
   - Delete: Soft delete with 30-day undo period
   - Export: Column selector, format chooser (CSV/Excel)

3. **Bulk Import Validation:**
   - Upload CSV with field mapping
   - Per-row validation (E.164, email, domain)
   - Error queue table with download
   - Retry failed rows

**Deliverable:** High-velocity data operations

---

### ⚪ **Phase 6: Validation & Compliance** (4-6 hours)
**Goal:** GDPR/CCPA-aligned data handling

1. **Automatic Validation:**
   - E.164 phone validation on input
   - Email format + DNS verification
   - Domain format validation
   - Consent field enforcement (require basis + source)

2. **Audit Logging:**
   - Log all bulk operations
   - Track consent changes
   - Record field-level edits

3. **Field-level RBAC:**
   - Hide consent fields from non-admin users
   - Redact sensitive data based on role

**Deliverable:** Compliance-ready data management

## 6. Effort Summary

| Phase | Feature Set | Complexity | Estimated Hours | Priority |
|-------|-------------|------------|-----------------|----------|
| 1 | Schema Updates | Low | 1-2 | 🔴 Critical |
| 2 | Linking & Relationships | Medium | 3-4 | 🔴 Critical |
| 3 | Record Detail Views | Medium | 4-6 | 🟠 High |
| 4 | Advanced Filtering | High | 6-8 | 🟡 Medium |
| 5 | Bulk Operations | High | 8-12 | 🟢 Medium |
| 6 | Validation & Compliance | Medium | 4-6 | ⚪ Low |
| **TOTAL** | **Complete Upgrade** | **Mixed** | **26-38 hours** | - |

---

## 7. Quick Wins (Immediate Impact)

These can be done in <2 hours and provide significant value:

1. **Schema Completion** (1 hour)
   - Add 5 missing fields
   - Push to database
   - Update TypeScript types

2. **Domain-Based Auto-Linking** (1 hour)
   - Backend: Extract domain from contact email → match to account.domain
   - Run once as batch job to link existing contacts
   - Enable on future contact creates

3. **Account Contacts List** (30 min)
   - Add tab to account page
   - Show related contacts
   - "Add Contact" button pre-fills account_id

**Impact:** Achieves 40% of upgrade plan value with minimal effort

---

## 8. Decision Points

### Question 1: Technologies Field Naming
- Current schema has `tech_stack[]` 
- Requirements mention `technologies_installed[]`
- **Recommendation:** Keep `tech_stack` (simpler) or create alias

### Question 2: Tags Implementation
- Need tags on both Accounts and Contacts
- **Options:**
  - A) Simple TEXT[] array (lightweight, no relationships)
  - B) Separate tags table with M:M relationships (complex, reusable)
- **Recommendation:** Option A for MVP, upgrade to B if tag management becomes critical

### Question 3: Soft Delete vs Hard Delete
- Bulk delete with undo period requires soft delete
- **Options:**
  - A) Add `deleted_at TIMESTAMP` to accounts/contacts
  - B) Move to `deleted_accounts`/`deleted_contacts` tables
- **Recommendation:** Option A (simpler queries, easy undo)

---

## 9. Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Parent-child account cycles | Data integrity | Add cycle detection logic |
| Bulk operations timeout | User experience | Implement async job queue (BullMQ) |
| Complex filter performance | Slow queries | Add database indexes, query optimization |
| Merge conflicts | Data loss | Implement merge preview + undo window |
| RBAC bypass in bulk ops | Security | Enforce role checks on every record |

---

## 10. Success Metrics

- ✅ 100% schema field coverage
- ✅ Auto-link 95%+ contacts to accounts via domain matching
- ✅ <2 seconds query time for complex filters
- ✅ Bulk operations support 10k+ records
- ✅ Zero GDPR compliance gaps
- ✅ 100% audit coverage for sensitive operations

---

## Conclusion

**Current State:** Strong foundation (85% complete) with all critical fields in place

**Gap:** Primarily UI/UX features and operational tooling, not data model deficiencies

**Path Forward:** 
1. Complete schema (1-2 hours) ← **START HERE**
2. Build linking system (3-4 hours)
3. Add detail views (4-6 hours)
4. Implement advanced filters (6-8 hours)
5. Build bulk operations (8-12 hours)
6. Add validation layer (4-6 hours)

**Total Investment:** 26-38 hours for complete upgrade

**Quick Win Option:** Focus on Phases 1-2 (4-6 hours) for 40% of value
