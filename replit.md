# Pivotal B2B CRM

## Overview

Pivotal CRM is an enterprise-grade B2B customer relationship management platform focused on Account-Based Marketing (ABM), multi-channel campaign management (Email + Telemarketing), lead qualification, and a client portal. It features a "bridge model" for manual campaign-to-order linking, robust compliance management (DNC/Unsubscribe), and comprehensive lead QA workflows. The system aims to provide an integrated solution for B2B sales and marketing operations, enabling efficient customer engagement and data management.

## User Preferences

- Clean, minimal enterprise design
- Professional blue color scheme (trust, reliability)
- Dense information display with clear hierarchy
- Fast, keyboard-friendly workflows
- Comprehensive but not overwhelming

## System Architecture

The system employs a modern web stack: **React 18 + Vite, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and shadcn/ui** for the frontend, and **Node.js + Express + TypeScript** with a **PostgreSQL (Neon) database via Drizzle ORM** for the backend. JWT authentication secures role-based access.

**UI/UX Design:**
- **Color Scheme:** Primary blue (220 90% 56%) for professionalism, adaptive light/dark surfaces, and semantic status colors.
- **Typography:** Inter font family for text, JetBrains Mono for data.
- **Components:** Utilizes shadcn/ui for consistent enterprise-grade components including role-based sidebar navigation, top bar with global search, data tables with advanced features, and step wizards.
- **Dark Mode:** Fully implemented with theme toggle and localStorage persistence.

**Technical Implementations & Features:**

- **Data Model:** Core entities include Users (with RBAC), Accounts (with domain matching, hierarchies, custom fields, and AI-powered industry enrichment), Contacts (with E.164 validation, normalized fields for deduplication), Dynamic Segments, Static Lists, Domain Sets, Campaigns (Email & Telemarketing), Leads (with multi-stage QA workflow), Suppressions (DNC/Unsubscribe), and Campaign Orders.
- **Audience Management:** Advanced multi-criteria filtering with AND/OR logic and saved filters, dynamic segments with real-time counts, static lists, and domain set uploader with match rate reporting. Supports 52+ filter fields categorized dynamically.
- **Data Quality & Deduplication:** Implemented deterministic upsert with field-level survivorship, normalization (email, domain, name, phone), source tracking, soft deletes, and secondary identifiers. Includes an audit trail for all field-level changes.
- **Bulk Operations:** Infrastructure for selecting multiple records across pages, with a bulk actions toolbar for operations like Export, Add to List, Update, and Delete.
- **Campaign Management:**
    - **Email:** HTML editor, personalization, tracking, pre-send guards, mandatory unsubscribe.
    - **Telemarketing:** Telnyx WebRTC integration, call scripts, qualification forms, DNC handling.
- **Lead QA Workflow:** Multi-stage workflow (New → Under Review → Approved/Rejected → Published) with checklist validation and bulk actions. Only approved leads are deliverable.
- **Client Portal (Bridge Model):** Allows clients to specify audience, type, assets, and goals for campaign orders. Existing campaigns are manually linked to orders by internal operations (no auto-creation). Provides order-scoped dashboards and lead downloads.
- **Compliance:** Real-time enforcement of global DNC and email unsubscribe lists. Supports consent tracking.
- **Security:** JWT token generation, bcrypt password hashing, and role-based access control (RBAC) middleware for all API routes.
