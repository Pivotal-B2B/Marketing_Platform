## Architecture

### Data Model

**Core Entities:**
- **Users** - Authentication with role-based access (admin, campaign_manager, data_ops, qa_analyst, agent, client_user)
- **Accounts** - Company records with domain-based matching, custom fields (JSONB)
- **Contacts** - Individual contacts linked to accounts, E.164 phone validation
- **Segments** - Dynamic audience filters with AND/OR logic
- **Lists** - Static contact snapshots
- **Domain Sets** - Upload domains, normalize, match to accounts, expand to contacts
- **Campaigns** - Email and telemarketing campaigns with audience targeting
- **Leads** - QA workflow (New → Under Review → Approved/Rejected → Published)
- **Suppressions** - DNC (phone) and Unsubscribe (email) enforcement
- **Campaign Orders** - Client portal orders with manual campaign linking (bridge model)

### Key Features

**Audience Management:**
- Advanced filtering with custom fields support
- Dynamic segments with real-time preview counts
- Static lists for campaign snapshots

- Order-scoped dashboards and reporting
- Download approved leads only

**Compliance:**

## Running the Project

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Push database schema
npm run db:push

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at http://localhost:5000

## Key Principles

1. **Bridge Model** - Orders never auto-create campaigns; ops manually links
2. **Role-Based Access** - Users see only what they need
3. **Compliance First** - DNC/Unsubscribe enforced before send/dial
4. **Quality Over Quantity** - Only approved leads count
5. **Audit Everything** - All critical actions logged
6. **2-Click Access** - Primary actions visible and accessible

## Recent Changes

- 2024-01-12: Initial project setup with complete schema and frontend components

- All page components built with responsive design
- Dark mode support implemented
- Design system established with Inter font

## User Preferences

- Clean, minimal enterprise design
