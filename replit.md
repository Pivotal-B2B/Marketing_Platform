## Production Database Setup
The system automatically initializes the production database with a default admin user when deployed with an empty database.

**Automatic Database Initialization:**
- **Smart Detection:** Checks if users exist on server startup
- **Auto-Create Admin:** If database is empty, creates default admin user automatically
- **No Duplicates:** Skips initialization if users already exist
- **Implementation:** `server/db-init.ts` runs during server startup (`server/index.ts`)

**Default Admin Credentials (Production):**
- **Username:** admin
- **Email:** admin@crm.local  
- **Password:** Admin123!
- **Role:** admin (with full permissions)

**Customizing Admin Credentials:**
To customize the default admin user, set these environment variables in Replit Secrets:
- `ADMIN_USERNAME` - Custom admin username (default: "admin")
- `ADMIN_EMAIL` - Custom admin email (default: "admin@crm.local")
- `ADMIN_PASSWORD` - Custom admin password (default: "Admin123!")
- `ADMIN_FIRST_NAME` - Custom first name (default: "Admin")
- `ADMIN_LAST_NAME` - Custom last name (default: "User")

**Security Note:**
- Change the default password immediately after first login in production
- Use Settings → User Management to create additional admin users
- Development and production databases are completely separate (no data sharing)
