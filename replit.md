## User Preferences
- Clean, minimal enterprise design
- Professional blue color scheme (trust, reliability)
- Dense information display with clear hierarchy
- Fast, keyboard-friendly workflows
- Comprehensive but not overwhelming

## System Architecture
The system employs a modern web stack: **React 18 + Vite, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and shadcn/ui** for the frontend, and **Node.js + Express + TypeScript** with a **PostgreSQL (Neon) database via Drizzle ORM** for the backend. JWT authentication provides role-based access control.

**UI/UX Design:**
- **Color Scheme:** Primary Royal Blue with Teal accent, adaptive light/dark surfaces, and semantic status colors.
- **Typography:** Inter font for text, JetBrains Mono for data.
- **Components:** shadcn/ui for consistent enterprise components, including role-based sidebar navigation, global search, data tables, and step wizards.
- **Dark Mode:** Fully implemented with theme toggle and localStorage persistence.
- **Global UX/UI Upgrade:** Reusable components like `HeaderActionBar`, `IconButton`, and `SectionCard` for consistent interaction patterns.
- **Premium Design System:** Incorporates animations (fade-in, count-up, pulse-glow), visual effects (glass morphism, gradient borders), enhanced components (animated stat cards, premium login), micro-interactions (card elevation on hover, icon scaling), and gradient utilities.
- **Advanced Filtering:** `AdvancedFilterBar` component with multi-operator support and filter chips.
- **View Toggle System:** Dual-view architecture for Accounts (Cards/Table) with seamless state preservation, including a Premium Card View with gradient avatars and animated hover effects.
- **Accessibility:** Full keyboard accessibility and bulk selection support.

**Technical Implementations & Features:**
- **Data Model:** Core entities include Users (RBAC), Accounts (AI enrichment), Contacts (validation/deduplication), Dynamic Segments, Static Lists, Domain Sets, Campaigns (Email & Telemarketing), Leads (multi-stage QA workflow), Suppressions, and Campaign Orders.
- **Pivotal B2B Standard Master Data Template:** 100% compatibility with internal data standard. 25 contact fields (Research Date, Full Name, Title, Email/Phone with AI confidence scores, location, tenure) and 21 account fields (Company location, revenue ranges, LinkedIn IDs, SIC/NAICS codes). Automated CSV field mapping recognizes exact template headers.
- **Audience Management:** Advanced multi-criteria filtering, dynamic segments, static lists, and domain set uploaders.
- **Data Quality & Deduplication:** Deterministic upsert, normalization, source tracking, and soft deletes.
- **Unified CSV Import/Export System with Field Mapping:** RFC4180-compliant CSV parsing with smart field mapping, batch processing, and intelligent matching. Auto-detects Pivotal B2B Standard Template columns.
  - **Bulk Database Operations Optimization:** Dramatically improved CSV import performance using bulk inserts and batch queries:
    - Single bulk query to fetch existing accounts by domains (vs N individual queries)
    - Single bulk insert for new accounts (vs N individual inserts)
    - Bulk email and phone suppression checks (2 queries vs 2N queries)
    - Single bulk insert for contacts (vs N individual inserts)
    - Reduces database round-trips from O(N) to O(1) where N is number of records
- **Bulk Operations:** Multi-page record selection with bulk actions (Export, Add to List, Update, Delete).
- **Campaign Management:**
    - **Email:** HTML editor, personalization, tracking, pre-send guards, mandatory unsubscribe.
    - **Telemarketing:** Telnyx WebRTC integration with browser-based calling, real-time SIP trunk management, call scripts, qualification forms, DNC handling, Agent Console with disposition workflow and live audio.
    - **Advanced Features:** Audience snapshotting, compliance guardrails, pacing/throttling, frequency caps, multi-provider email support, A/B/n testing, pre-flight checklists, and reporting.
- **Account Lead Cap Implementation:** Intelligent contact distribution system to prevent over-contacting accounts across campaigns, with configurable cap modes (Queue Size, Connected Calls, Positive Dispositions).
- **Lead QA Workflow:** Multi-stage workflow (New → Under Review → Approved/Rejected → Published) with checklist validation.
- **Client Portal (Bridge Model):** Allows clients to specify campaign order requirements.
- **Compliance:** Real-time enforcement of global DNC and email unsubscribe lists; consent tracking.
- **Security:** JWT token generation, bcrypt password hashing, and role-based access control (RBAC).
- **Multi-Role User Management System:**
    - **Many-to-Many Role Assignment:** Users can be assigned multiple roles simultaneously via user_roles junction table (admin, agent, quality_analyst, content_creator, campaign_manager)
    - **Enhanced JWT Authentication:** JWT payload includes roles array; RBAC middleware checks if user has any of the allowed roles
    - **Admin-Only Role Management API:** Full CRUD operations for user roles (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/users/:userId/roles) with audit trail (assignedBy tracking)
    - **Checkbox-Based Multi-Role UI:** User management interface with checkbox selection for multiple roles, real-time updates, and multiple role badges display
    - **Legacy Compatibility:** Maintains backward compatibility with legacy single role field while prioritizing roles array
    - **Migration Endpoint:** One-time migration API (POST /api/users/migrate-roles) to convert existing users to multi-role system
- **Segmentation Engine:** Enhanced schemas for segments and lists, segment preview API, and conversion/export functionalities.
- **Domain Sets Upgrade:** Advanced normalization, validation, and matching engine for ABM.
- **Content Studio & Social Media Management:** Unified asset library with version control, AI content generator, and multi-platform social media publishing with scheduling.
- **Inter-Repl Communication (Push to Resources Center):** Secure content distribution to an external Resources Center via HMAC-authenticated API.
- **Resources Centre Integration:** Bi-directional integration for content distribution and reference data sync (speakers, organizers, sponsors), with admin UI for management.
- **Email Infrastructure Settings:** Enterprise-grade email deliverability management including domain authentication, tracking domains, IP pools, warmup plans, and sender profiles with full CRUD management.
- **Campaign-Content Linking & Tracking URL System:** Integration with Resources Centre for linking campaigns to external content and generating personalized tracking URLs.
- **Telephony - Telnyx WebRTC Integration:**
    - **Browser-Based Calling:** Real WebRTC calling through Telnyx SDK (@telnyx/webrtc) enabling agents to make actual phone calls directly from the browser
    - **SIP Trunk Management:** Admin UI for configuring and managing multiple SIP trunk credentials with default trunk selection and active/inactive status toggles
    - **WebRTC Hook (useTelnyxWebRTC):** React hook managing TelnyxRTC client lifecycle, call state transitions (connecting → ringing → active → hangup), call duration tracking, mute/unmute controls, and automatic error recovery
    - **Agent Console Integration:** Real-time call controls (dial, hangup, mute), live call status indicators, audio playback through dedicated HTML5 audio element, and seamless disposition workflow after call completion
    - **Security:** SIP credentials stored securely in database with RBAC enforcement; agents retrieve default trunk config via authenticated API endpoint

## Production Database Setup
The system automatically initializes the production database with a default admin user when deployed with an empty database.

**Automatic Database Initialization:**
- **Smart Detection:** Checks if users exist on server startup
- **Auto-Create Admin:** If database is empty, creates default admin user automatically
- **No Duplicates:** Skips initialization if users already exist
- **Implementation:** `server/db-init.ts` runs during server startup (`server/index.ts`)

**Default Admin Credentials (Production):**
- **Username:** admin
- **Email:** admin@crm.local  
- **Password:** Admin123!
- **Role:** admin (with full permissions)

**Customizing Admin Credentials:**
To customize the default admin user, set these environment variables in Replit Secrets:
- `ADMIN_USERNAME` - Custom admin username (default: "admin")
- `ADMIN_EMAIL` - Custom admin email (default: "admin@crm.local")
- `ADMIN_PASSWORD` - Custom admin password (default: "Admin123!")
- `ADMIN_FIRST_NAME` - Custom first name (default: "Admin")
- `ADMIN_LAST_NAME` - Custom last name (default: "User")

**Security Note:**
- Change the default password immediately after first login in production
- Use Settings → User Management to create additional admin users
- Development and production databases are completely separate (no data sharing)
