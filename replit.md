# Pivotal B2B CRM

## Overview

Pivotal CRM is an enterprise-grade B2B customer relationship management platform designed for Account-Based Marketing (ABM), multi-channel campaign management (Email + Telemarketing), lead qualification, and a client portal. It incorporates a unique "bridge model" for manual campaign-to-order linking, ensuring compliance management (DNC/Unsubscribe) and robust lead QA workflows. The system aims to provide a comprehensive solution for managing B2B sales and marketing operations.

## User Preferences

- Fast, keyboard-friendly workflows
- Comprehensive but not overwhelming

## System Architecture

The system utilizes a modern web stack with **React 18 + Vite, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and shadcn/ui** for the frontend, and **Node.js + Express + TypeScript** with a **PostgreSQL (Neon) database via Drizzle ORM** for the backend. JWT authentication secures role-based access.

**UI/UX Design:**
- **Color Scheme:** Primary blue (220 90% 56%) for trust and professionalism, adaptive light/dark surfaces, and semantic colors for status.
- **Typography:** Inter font family for main text, JetBrains Mono for data fields.
- **Components:** Leverages shadcn/ui for consistent enterprise-grade components including role-based sidebar navigation, top bar with global search, data tables with advanced features, and step wizards.
- **Dark Mode:** Fully implemented with theme toggle and localStorage persistence.

**Technical Implementations & Features:**

- **Data Model:** Core entities include Users (with role-based access: admin, campaign_manager, data_ops, qa_analyst, agent, client_user), Accounts (with domain matching, hierarchies, and custom fields), Contacts (with E.164 validation), Dynamic Segments, Static Lists, Domain Sets, Campaigns (Email & Telemarketing), Leads (with QA workflow), Suppressions (DNC/Unsubscribe), and Campaign Orders.
- **Audience Management:** Advanced filtering, dynamic segments with real-time counts, static lists, and domain set uploader with match rate reporting.
- **Campaign Management:**
    - **Email:** HTML editor, personalization, tracking, pre-send guards, mandatory unsubscribe.
    - **Telemarketing:** Telnyx WebRTC integration, call scripts, qualification forms, DNC handling.
- **Lead QA Workflow:** Multi-stage (New â†’ Under Review â†’ Approved/Rejected â†’ Published) with checklist validation and bulk actions. Only approved leads are deliverable.
- **Client Portal (Bridge Model):** Campaign order wizard allows clients to specify audience, type, assets, and goals. **Crucially, existing campaigns are manually linked to orders by internal operations; there is NO auto-creation of campaigns.** Provides order-scoped dashboards and allows download of approved leads.
- **Compliance:** Global DNC and email unsubscribe lists are enforced in real-time. Consent tracking is also supported.
- **Security:** JWT token generation, bcrypt password hashing, and role-based access control (RBAC) middleware for all API routes.
