## Recent Changes (October 2025)
- **Location/Address Field Visibility Enhancement**: Enhanced contact and account detail pages to always display location/address fields in main grid, eliminating conditional rendering that hid these fields when empty. Contact detail page now shows City, State, County, Postal Code, Country fields in main grid with "-" fallbacks; Street Address and Full Location String remain in conditional section. Account detail page now displays HQ City, HQ State, HQ Postal Code, HQ Country as individual always-visible fields in main grid (previously combined into single "Headquarters" field); Year Founded also made always-visible. Street address lines remain conditionally rendered to avoid clutter when empty.
- **Critical Role Name Fix**: Fixed critical bug where code was checking for 'qa_analyst' role but database defined 'quality_analyst' role, preventing QA analysts from accessing their features. Updated all role checks across frontend (dashboard.tsx, app-sidebar.tsx, lead-detail.tsx) and backend (routes.ts, validation schemas) to use correct 'quality_analyst' role name matching database enum. QA analysts can now access QA & Leads section in sidebar and see full dashboard instead of agent-limited view.
- **Multi-Role RBAC Fix**: Fixed critical bug where users with multiple roles (e.g., Agent + QA Analyst) only saw agent-limited features instead of full dashboard access. Dashboard now correctly shows agent view ONLY for users with agent role and no elevated roles; multi-role users (agent + quality_analyst/admin/campaign_manager) now see full dashboard with all features.
- **Login Flow Fix**: Resolved race condition causing login to require two attempts. Login now uses React useEffect to wait for authentication state update before redirecting, ensuring reliable first-attempt login success.
- **Comprehensive Responsive Design**: Implemented mobile-first responsive design across entire application:
  - **Agent Console**: Converted fixed-width panels (18%/70%/30%) to responsive flex layout - panels stack vertically on mobile/tablet, display side-by-side on desktop (lg: 1024px+)
  - **Dashboard**: Hero section and stat cards optimized with responsive text sizes, padding, and grid layouts (1 column mobile → 2 columns tablet → 4 columns desktop)
  - **TopBar**: Condensed layout for mobile with responsive padding, gap adjustments, and hidden non-critical controls on small screens
  - **App Layout**: Responsive padding system (p-3 sm:p-4 md:p-6) for optimal spacing across all viewport sizes
  - **Breakpoint Strategy**: Consistent use of Tailwind breakpoints - sm: 640px, md: 768px, lg: 1024px
  - **Touch-Friendly**: All interactive elements properly sized for mobile touch interaction
  - **Contact Info**: Responsive grids that stack on mobile for better readability
- **Automatic DNC Handling**: When agents select "Do Not Call" disposition, both directPhoneE164 and mobilePhoneE164 are automatically added to global phone suppression list with reason tracking. Graceful duplicate-key handling ensures call logging never fails.
- **Queue Limit Increase**: Maximum manual queue limit increased from 100 to 1000 contacts, allowing agents to bulk-load larger batches for efficient calling sessions.
- **Disposition UI Clarity**: Changed disposition label from "DNC" to "Do Not Call" in Agent Console for better clarity and professionalism.
- **Campaign-Level Suppression System**: Implemented intelligent suppression list management for telemarketing campaigns with both account-level and contact-level suppression. Features include:
  - Database tables: `campaign_suppression_accounts` and `campaign_suppression_contacts` with composite unique constraints
  - RESTful API endpoints for adding/removing/listing suppressions with bulk operations support
  - Automatic enforcement in both Manual and Power Dial queue builders
  - Multi-tier suppression hierarchy: campaign-level contact > campaign-level account > global email DNC > global phone DNC
  - Suppressed contacts and accounts are automatically skipped during queue building with detailed logging
- **Agent-Specific Dashboard**: Implemented personalized dashboard views for agent role users showing individual performance metrics (calls today/month, qualified leads, average call duration, approved/pending leads, and active campaigns). Admin/manager users continue to see global statistics.
- **Filter Options Fix**: Fixed filter dropdown endpoints to query actual database tables instead of showing empty results or text boxes:
  - `/api/filters/options/lists` - Now queries `lists` table to show actual Static Lists
  - `/api/filters/options/segments` - Now queries `segments` table to show actual Dynamic Segments (was returning empty array)
  - `/api/filters/options/domain-sets` - New endpoint that queries `domainSets` table to show Domain Sets/TAL
- **Null-Safety Improvements**: Enhanced agent dashboard with crash-resistant error handling using nullish coalescing operators and toast-based error notifications for API failures.

## User Preferences
- Clean, minimal enterprise design
- Professional blue color scheme (trust, reliability)

## System Architecture
The system employs a modern web stack: **React 18 + Vite, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and shadcn/ui** for the frontend, and **Node.js + Express + TypeScript** with a **PostgreSQL (Neon) database via Drizzle ORM** for the backend. JWT authentication provides role-based access control.

**UI/UX Design:**
- **Color Scheme:** Primary Royal Blue with Teal accent, adaptive light/dark surfaces, and semantic status colors.
- **Typography:** Inter font for text, JetBrains Mono for data.
- **Components:** shadcn/ui for consistent enterprise components, including role-based sidebar navigation, global search, data tables, and step wizards.
- **Design System:** Comprehensive design system upgrade with accessible, high-performance pattern components incorporating design tokens.
- **Advanced Filtering:** `AdvancedFilterBar` component with multi-operator support and filter chips.
- **View Toggle System:** Dual-view architecture for Accounts (Cards/Table) with seamless state preservation.
- **Navigation Pattern:** Enterprise-standard layout with core business features (CRM, Campaigns, Analytics, Content, DV Projects) in left sidebar, and administrative settings (Infrastructure, Organization) in top-right Settings dropdown menu (admin-only).

**Technical Implementations & Features:**
- **Data Model:** Core entities include Users (RBAC), Accounts (AI enrichment), Contacts (validation/deduplication), Dynamic Segments, Static Lists, Domain Sets, Campaigns (Email & Telemarketing), Leads (multi-stage QA workflow), Suppressions, and Campaign Orders.
- **AI-Powered Quality Assurance:** Integrates AssemblyAI for call transcription and Replit AI (OpenAI-compatible) for lead qualification scoring, account enrichment, and multi-factor scoring.
- **Data Management:** Unified CSV Import/Export System, platform-wide dynamic filters with collapsible category accordions, multi-select dropdowns, async type-ahead search, and date range pickers. Filter options pull from actual database values, and RBAC enforces filter visibility.
- **Compliance & Suppression:** Multi-tier suppression system with campaign-level and global enforcement:
  - **Global Suppressions**: Platform-wide DNC lists for emails (unsubscribe) and phones (Do Not Call)
  - **Campaign Suppressions**: Campaign-specific suppression lists for accounts (entire company) and contacts (individuals)
  - **Enforcement**: Automatic checks in Manual Queue and Power Dial modes prevent suppressed contacts from being queued
  - **API Management**: RESTful endpoints for adding/removing suppressions with bulk operations and reason tracking
- **Campaign Management:**
    - **Email:** HTML editor, personalization, tracking, pre-send guards, mandatory unsubscribe.
    - **Telemarketing - Dual Dialer Strategy:** Supports Manual Dial Mode (agent-driven queue with collision prevention) and Power Dial Mode (automated dialing with AMD, pacing engine, and human-only agent routing). Includes AMD with confidence scoring, Voicemail Policy Executor, and campaign builder integration for dial mode configuration.
    - **Dynamic Call Script Personalization:** Agent Console features comprehensive placeholder replacement system supporting {{contact.*}}, {{account.*}}, {{agent.*}}, and {{campaign.*}} variables, as well as legacy [Bracket] format for backwards compatibility. Scripts automatically populate with contact details (name, email, job title), account information (name, industry, revenue), and agent information from active queue contact.
    - **Call Recording Integration:** Full Telnyx recording integration with automated capture, webhook processing, and secure playback. WebRTC client enables recording on all calls (record-from-answer). Webhook handler processes call.recording.saved events asynchronously, fetches signed URLs from Telnyx API, and updates call_attempts and leads tables. Recording access endpoint generates time-limited signed URLs (1-hour expiry) with RBAC enforcement and audit logging. Call control IDs captured during calls link to Telnyx recordings for playback/download in Lead QA workflow.
- **Lead QA Workflow:** Multi-stage workflow (New → Under Review → Approved/Rejected → Published) with checklist validation and agent insights.
- **Comprehensive Lead Detail Page:** Full-featured detail view displaying contact information, account details, assigned agent, campaign context, playable call recording with progress tracking and download, AI qualification analysis, call transcript, and QA approval workflow. Includes RBAC-enforced approve/reject actions for admin and quality_analyst roles.
