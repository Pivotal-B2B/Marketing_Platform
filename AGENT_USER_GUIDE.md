## Dispositioning Calls (CRITICAL)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è WHY DISPOSITIONS ARE CRITICAL

**Dispositions are the single most important step in your workflow because:**

1. **Data Accuracy:** They record the outcome of every call attempt
2. **Campaign Tracking:** Managers use this data to measure campaign success
3. **Follow-up Actions:** Determines if and when to contact this person again
4. **Compliance:** Required for regulatory reporting (Do Not Call lists)
5. **Performance Metrics:** Your productivity is measured by completed dispositions
6. **Queue Management:** You cannot move to the next contact without completing it

> **üö´ YOU CANNOT SKIP DISPOSITIONS!** The system will block you from making another call until you complete the disposition for the current contact.

### How to Complete a Disposition

**Step 1: Call Ends**
- After you click "Hang Up", status changes to "Wrap-Up"
- Disposition form appears at the bottom of the screen

**Step 2: Select Disposition Code**
Choose the appropriate outcome:

| Disposition | When to Use |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Connected** | Successfully spoke with the contact |
| **Voicemail** | Reached voicemail, left message |
| **No Answer** | Phone rang but no one answered |
| **Busy** | Line was busy |
| **Wrong Number** | Number doesn't belong to contact |
| **Not Interested** | Contact declined/not interested |
| **Callback Requested** | Contact asked to be called back later |
| **Do Not Call** | Contact requested to be removed from calling list |
| **Gatekeeper** | Spoke with assistant/receptionist |
| **Qualified** | Contact meets qualification criteria |
| **Not Qualified** | Contact doesn't meet criteria |

**Step 3: Add Call Notes**
- Document key points from the conversation
- Include any action items or follow-up needed
- Note contact's specific feedback or concerns
- Be clear and concise

**Step 4: Set Callback (if applicable)**
- If contact requested callback, set date/time
- System will re-queue this contact automatically

**Step 5: Save Disposition**
1. Click **"Save Disposition"** button
2. Wait for confirmation message
3. System automatically advances to next contact

### Best Practices for Dispositions

‚úÖ **DO:**
- Complete disposition immediately after each call
- Be accurate and honest
- Add detailed notes
- Use "Do Not Call" when requested

‚ùå **DON'T:**
- Skip or rush through dispositions
- Use incorrect codes to inflate metrics

## Call Scripts & Personalization

### Understanding the Script

The call script appears below the contact information and is **automatically personalized** with:

**Contact Information:**
- Full Name, First Name, Last Name
- Job Title
- Department
- Seniority Level
- Direct Phone, Mobile Phone
- Email Address
- Location (City, State, Country)
- LinkedIn URL

**Company Information:**
- Company Name
- Company Domain
- Industry
- Staff Count
- Annual Revenue
- Main Phone Number
- Headquarters Location
- Year Founded
- Technology Stack
- Company LinkedIn URL

### How to Use the Script

1. **Review Before Calling:** Read through the script before dialing
2. **Personalize Your Delivery:** Don't sound like you're reading robotically
3. **Use Placeholders:** Fields like `{{firstName}}` will show "John" for example
4. **Adapt as Needed:** Script is a guide, adjust based on conversation flow
5. **Handle Objections:** Script may include objection handling sections

### Example Script with Personalization

```
Hi {{firstName}}, this is [Your Name] from Pivotal B2B.

I'm reaching out because I noticed {{companyName}} is in the {{industry}} 
industry, and we help companies like yours improve their sales processes.

I see you're the {{jobTitle}} - is this still accurate?

[Continue with your pitch...]
```

**This would appear to the agent as:**

```
Hi John, this is Sarah from Pivotal B2B.

I'm reaching out because I noticed Acme Corporation is in the Technology 
industry, and we help companies like yours improve their sales processes.

I see you're the VP of Sales - is this still accurate?

[Continue with your pitch...]
```

3. You control the pacing
4. Can add contacts to your queue

**Best For:**
- Complex sales cycles
- High-value prospects
- Personalized outreach
